starts:
i'm
standing
there
on
a
balcony
in
summer
air
see
the
lights
see
the
party
the
ball
gowns
see
you
make
your
way
through
the
crowd
and
say
&quot;hello.&quot;
little
did
i
know
that
you
were
romeo
you
were
throwing
pebbles
and
my
daddy
said
&quot;stay
away
from
juliet.&quot;
and
i
was
crying
on
the
staircase
begging
you
&quot;please
don't
go.&quot;
and
i
said
&quot;romeo
take
me
somewhere
we
can
be
alone
i'll
be
waiting.
all
there's
left
to
do
is
run
you'll
be
the
prince
and
i'll
be
the
princess
it's
a
love
story.

just
say
'yes'.&quot;
so
i
sneak
out
to
the
garden
to
see
you
we
keep
quiet
'cause
we're
dead
if
they
knew
so
close
your
eyes
escape
this
town
for
a
little
while

you
were
romeo.
i
was
a
scarlet
letter
and
my

said
&quot;stay
away
from

you
were
everything
to
me

was

to
feel
this
love
is
difficult

it's
real
don't
be
afraid.

you
was
fading

and
look
into
your
heart
and
you'll
find
love

love
love
listen
to
the
music
of
the
moment
people
dance
and
sing
we're
just
one
big
family
and
it's
our
god-forsaken
right
to
be
loved
loved

been
spending
way
too
long
checking
my
tongue
in
the
mirror
and
bending
over
backwards
just
to
try
to
see
it
clearer
but
my
breath
fogged
up
the
glass
and
so
i
drew
a
new
face
and
i
laughed
i
guess
what
i'll
be
saying
is
there
ain't
no
better
reason
to
rid
yourself
of
vanities
and
just
go
with
the
seasons
it's
what
we
aim
to
do
our
name
is
our
virtue
but
i
won't
hesitate
no
more
no
more
it
cannot

immaculately
polished
with
the
spirit
of
a
hustler
and
the
swagger
of
a
college
kid.
allergic
to
the
counterfeit
impartial
to
the
politics.
articulate

a
disarray
prioritizing
horribly.
unhappy
with
the
riches
'cause
your
piss
poor
morally.
ignoring
all
prior
advice
and
fore
warning.

full
of
ourselves

who
got
thrown
under
the
bus
kiss
my
butt
lick
fromunda
cheese
from
under
my
nuts
it
disgusts
me
to
see
the
game
the
way
that
it
looks
it's
a
must
i
redeem

worse
than
worcestershire
sauce

i
could
fit
the
words
it's
picture
perfect
works
every
time
every
verse
every
line
as
simple
as
nursery
rhymes
it's
elementary
the
elephants
have
entered
the

teach
me
how

a
sock
hop
beneath

'cause
i
hate
goodbyes

said
farewell
said
farewell
but
i'll
know
where
several
are
if
my
dreams
get
real
bizarre

i
saved
a

are
bursting
at

i
remembered
black
skies
the
lightning
all
around
me
i
remembered
each
flash
as
time
began
to
blur
like
a
startling
sign
that
fate
had
finally
found
me
and
your
voice
was
all
i
heard
that
i
get
what
i
deserve
so
give
me

connect
this
space
between
let
it
be
enough
to
reach
the
truth
that
lies
across
this
new
divide
there
was
nothing
in
sight
but
memories
left
abandoned
there
was
nowhere
to
hide
the
ashes
fell
like
snow
and
the
ground
caved
in
between
where
we
were
standing

your
voice
was
all
i
heard
that
i
get

i've
got
it
all
down
and
as
i
say
it
louder
i
love
how
it
sounds
'cause
i'm
not
taking
the
easy
way
out
not
wrappin'
this
in
ribbons
shouldn't
have
to
give
a
reason
why
it's
no
surprise

won't
be
here
tomorrow

can't
believe
that
i
stayed
'til
today

you
and
i
will
be
a
tough
act
to
follow
but
i
know
in
time
we'll
find
this
was
no
surprise
it
came
out
like
a
river
once
i
let
it
out
when
i
thought
that
i
wouldn't
know
how
held
onto
it
forever
just
pushing
it
down
it
felt
so
good
to
let
go
of
it
now
not
wrapping
this
in
ribbons
shouldn't
have
to
give
a
reason
why
it's
no
surprise
i
won't
be
here
tomorrow
i
can't
believe
that
i
stayed
'til
today
there's
nothing
here
in
this
heart
left
to
borrow
there's
nothing
here
in
this
soul
left
to
save
don't
be
surprised
when
we
hate
this
tomorrow
god
knows
we
tried
to
find
an
easier
way
yeah
you
and
i
will
be
a
tough
act
to
follow
but
i
know
in
time
we'll
find
this
was
no
surprise
our
favorite
place
we
used
to
go
the
warm
embrace
that
no
one
knows
the
lovin'
look
that's
left
your
eyes
that's
why
this
comes
as
no
as
no
surprise
if
i
could
see
the
future
and
how
this
plays
out
i
bet
it's
better
than
where
we
are
now
but
after
going
through
this
it's
easier
to
see
the
reason
why
it's
no
surprise

won't
be
here
tomorrow
i
can't

right
leave
no

behind

try

take
the

less
traveled

what's
worth
the
prize
is

worth
the

trying
not
to
stare
the
night
that
i
first
met
you
you
had
me
mesmerized
and
three
weeks
later
in
the
front
porch
light
taking
45
minutes
to
kiss
goodnight
i
hadn't
told
you
yet
but
i
thought
i
loved
you
then
and
now
you're
my
whole
life
now
you're
my
whole
world
i
just
can't
believe
the
way
i
feel
about
you
girl
like
a
river
meets
the
sea
stronger
than
it's
ever
been
we've
come
so
far
since
that
day
and
i
thought
i
loved
you
then
i
remember
taking
you
back
to
right
where
i
first
met
you
you
were
so
surprised
there
were
people
around
but
i
didn't
care
i
got
down
on
one
knee
right
there
and
once
again
i
thought
i
loved
you
then
but
now
you're
my
whole
life
now
you're
my
whole
world
i
just
can't
believe
the
way
i
feel
about
you
girl
like
a
river
meets
the
sea
stronger
than
it's
ever
been
we've
come
so
far
since
that
day
and
i
thought
i
loved
you
then
i
can
just
see
you
with
a
baby
on
the
way
i
can
just
see
you
when
your
hair
is
turning
grey
what
i
can't
see
is
how
i'm
ever
gonna
love
you
more
but
i've
said
that
before
and
now
you're
my
whole
life
now
you're
my
whole
world
i
just
can't
believe
the
way
i
feel
about
you
girl
we'll
look
back
someday
at
this
moment
that
we're
in
and
i'll
look
at
you
and
say
and
i
thought
i
loved
you
then
and
i
thought
i
loved
you
then
'oh
what
the
hell'
she
says
'i
just
can't
win
for
losing'
and
she
lays
back
down
man
there's
so
many
times
i
don't
know
what
i'm
doin'
like
i
don't
know
now
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
she
rubs
her
eyes
says
it's
funny
how
the
night
can
make
you
blind
i
can
just
imagine
imagine
and
i
don't
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
do
but
if
she
feels
bad
then
i
do
too
so
i
let
her
be
and
she
says
'ooh
i
can't
take
no
more'
her
tears
like
diamonds
on
the
floor
and
her
diamonds
bring
me
down
'cause
i
can't
help
her
now
she's
down
in
it
she
tried
her
best
and
now
she
can't
win
it's
hard
to
see
them
on
the
ground
her
diamonds
falling
down
way
down
way
down
well
she
sits
down
and
stares
into
the
distance
and
it
takes
all
night
all
night
and
i
know
i
could
break
her
concentration
oh
but
it
don't
feel
right
so
by
the
light
of
the
moon
she
rubs
her
eyes
sits
down
on
the
bed
and
starts
to
cry
and
there's
something
less
about
her
and
i
don't
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
do
so
i
sit
down
and
i
cry
too
but
don't
let
her
see
and
she
says
ooh
i
can't
take
no
more
her
tears
like
diamonds
on
the
floor
and
her
diamonds
bring
me
down
'cause
i
can't
help
her
now
she's
down
in
it
she
tried
her
best
and
now
she
can't
win
it's
hard
to
see
them
on
the
ground
her
diamonds
falling
down
she
shuts
out
the
night
and
tries
to
close
her
eyes
if
she
can
find
daylight
then
she'll
be
all
right
she'll
be
all
right
just
not
tonight
and
she
says
ooh
i
can't
take
no
more
her
tears
like
diamonds
on
the
floor
and
her
diamonds
