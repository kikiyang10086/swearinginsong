i've
been
staring
in
the
mirror
and
i'ts
very
slowly
picking
me
apart
i've
tried
to
tell
myself
i
have
no
reason
with
your
heart
now
just
the
other
night
while
you
were
sleeping
i
vaguely
heard
you
whisper
someone's
name

when
i
ask
you
of
the
thought's
your
keeping
you
just
say
nothing's
changed
well
i'm
a
man
of
many
wishes
i
hope
my
premenition
misses

my
eyes
wont
let
me

couldn't
keep
it
seems
no
one
can
help
me
now
i'm
in
too
deep
there's
no
way
out
this
time
i
have
really
lead
myself
astray
runaway
train
never
going
back
wrong
way
on
a
one-way
track
seems
like
i
should
be
getting
somewhere
somehow
i'm
neither
here
nor
there
can
you
help
me
remember
how
to
smile
make
it
somehow
all
seem
worthwhile
how
on
earth
did
i
get
so
jaded
life's
mysteries
seem
so
faded
i
can
go
where
no
one
else
can
go
i
know
what
no
one
else
knows
here
i
am
just
drowning
in
the
rain
with
a
ticket
for
a
runaway
train
and
everything
seems
cut
and
dry
day
and
night
earth
and
sky
somehow
i
just
don't
believe
it
runaway
train
never
going
back
wrong
way
on
a
one-way
track
seems
like
i
should
be
getting
somewhere
somehow
i'm
neither
here
nor
there
bought
a
ticket
for
a
runaway
train
like
a
madman
laughing
at
the
rain
a
little
out
of
touch
a
little
insane
it's
just
easier
than
dealing
with
the
pain
runaway
train
never
going
back
wrong
way
on
a
one-way
track
seems
like
i
should
be
getting
somewhere
somehow
i'm
neither
here
nor
there
runaway
train
never
coming
back
runaway
train
tearing
up
the
track
runaway
train
burning
in
my
veins
i
run
away
but
it
always
seems
the
same
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
go
walking
in
my
sleep
from
the
mountains
of
faith
to
a
river
so
deep
i
must
be
looking
for
something
something
sacred
i
lost
but
the
river
is
wide
and
it's
too
hard
to
cross
and
even
though
i
know
the
river
is
wide
i
walk
down
every
evening
and
i
stand
on
the
shore
and
try
to
cross
to
the
opposite
side
so
i
can
finally
find
out
what
i've
been
looking
for
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
go
walking
in
my
sleep
through
the
valley
of
fear
to
a
river
so
deep
and
i've
been
searching
for
something
taken
out
of
my
soul
something
i
would
never
lose
something
somebody
stole
i
don't
know
why
i
go
walking
at
night
but
now
i'm
tired
and
i
don't
want
to
walk
anymore
i
hope
it
doesn't
take
the
rest
of
my
life
until
i
find
what
it
is
that
i've
been
looking
for
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
go
walking
in
my
sleep
through
the
jungle
of
doubt
to
a
river
so
deep
i
know
i'm
searching
for
something
something
so
undefined
that
it
can
only
be
seen
by
the
eyes
of
the
blind
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i'm
not
sure
about
a
life
after
this
god
knows
i've
never
been
a
spiritual
man
baptized
by
the
fire
i
wade
into
the
river
that
runs
to
the
promised
land
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
go
walking
in
my
sleep
through
the
desert
of
truth
to
the
river
so
deep
we
all
end
in
the
ocean
we
all
start
in
the
streams
we're
all
carried
along
by
the
river
of
dreams
in
the
middle
of
the
night

princes

came
in
from
a
rainy
thursday
on
the
avenue
thought
i
heard
you
talking
softly
i
turned
on
the
lights
the
tv
and
the
radio
still
i
can't
escape
the
ghost
of
you
what
has
happened
to
it
all
crazy
some'd
say
where
is
the
life
that
i
recognize
gone
away
but
i
won't
cry
for
yesterday
there's
an
ordinary
world
somehow
i
have
to
find
and
as
i
try
to
make
my
way
to
the
ordinary
world
i
will
learn
to
survive
passion
or
coincidence
once
prompted
you
to
say
&quot;pride
will
tear
us
both
apart&quot;
well
now
pride's
gone
out
the
window
cross
the
rooftops
run
away
left
me
in
the
vacuum
of
my
heart
what
is
happening
to
me
crazy
some'd
say
where
is
my
friend
when
i
need
you
most
gone
away
but
i
won't
cry
for
yesterday
there's
an
ordinary
world
somehow
i
have
to
find
and
as
i
try
to
make
my
way
to
the
ordinary
world
i
will
learn
to
survive
papers
in
the
roadside
tell
of
suffering
and
greed
here
today
forgot
tomorrow
ooh
here
besides
the
news
of
holy
war
and
holy
need
ours
is
just
a
little
sorrowed
talk
and
i
don't
cry
for
yesterday
there's
an
ordinary
world
somehow
i
have
to
find
and
as
i
try
to
make
my
way
to
the
ordinary
world
i
will
learn
to
survive
every
one
is
my
world
i
will
learn
to
survive
any
one
is
my
world
i
will
learn
to
survive
any
one
is
my
world
every
one
is
my
world
and
i
would
do
anything
for
love
i'd
run
right
into
hell
and
back
i
would
do
anything
for
love
i'll
never
lie
to
you
and
that's
a
fact
but
i'll
never
forget
the
way
you
feel
right
now
oh
no
no
way
and
i
would
do
anything
for
love
but
i
won't
do
that
no
i
won't
do-
anything
for
love
oh
i
would
do
anything
for
love
i
would
do
anything
for

no
i
won't

that
and
some
days
it
don't
come
easy
and
some
days
it
don't
come
hard
some
days
it
don't
come
at
all
and
these
are
the
days
that
never
end
and
some
nights
you're
breathing
fire
and
some
nights
you're
carved
in
ice
some
nights
you're
like
nothing
i've
ever
seen
before
or
will
again
and
maybe
i'm
crazy
oh
it's
crazy
and
it's
true
i
know
you
can
save
me
no
one
else
can
save
me
now
but
you
as
long
as
the
planets
are
turning
as
long
as
the
stars
are
burning
as
long
as
your
dreams
are
coming
true-
you
better
believe
it
that
i
would
do
anything

wasted

wounded
at
this
old
piano
trying
hard
to
capture
the
moment
this
morning
i
don't
know
'cause
a
bottle
of
vodka's
still
lodged
in
my
head
and
some
blonde
gave
me
nightmares.
i
think
that
she's
still
in
my
bed.
as
i
dream
about
movies
they
won't
make
of
me
when
i'm
dead.
with
an
ironclad
fist
i
wake
up
and
french-kiss
the
morning
while
some
marching
band
keeps
its
own
beat
in
my
head
while
we're
talking
about
all
of
the
things
that
i
long
to
believe:
about
love
the
truth
what
you
mean
to
me.
and
the
truth
is
baby
you're
all
that
i
need.
i
wanna
lay
you
down
in
a
bed
of
roses
for
tonight
i'll
sleep
on
a
bed
of
nails.
oh
i
wanna
be
just
as
close
as
the
holy
ghost
is
and
lay
you
down
on
a
bed
of
roses.
well
i'm
so
far
away.
each
step
that
i
take
is
on
my
way
home.
a
king's
ransom
in
dimes
i'd
give
each
night
to
see
through
this
pay-phone.
still
i
run
out
of
time
or
it's
hard
to
get
through.
'til
the
bird
on
the
wire
flies
me
back
to
you
i'll
just
close
my
eyes
and
whisper
&quot;baby
blind
love
is
true.&quot;

wanna

well
this
hotel
bar's
hangover
whiskey's
gone
dry.
the
barkeeper's
wig's
crooked
and
she's
giving
me
the
eye.
well
i
might
have
said
yeah
but
i
laughed
so
hard
i
think
i
died.
now
as
you
close
your
eyes
know
i'll
be
thinking
about
you.
while
my
mistressxe2x80x94she
calls
me
to
stand
in
her
spotlight
again.
tonight
i
won't
be
alone
but
you
know
that
don't
mean
i'm
not
lonely.
i've
got
nothing
to
prove
for
it's
you
that
i'd
die
to
defend.
i
wanna
lay
you
down
in
a
bed
of
roses
for
tonight
i'll
sleep
on
a

down.

we
are
lovers
through
and
through
and
though
we
made
it
through
the
storm
i
really
want
you
to
realize
i
really
want
to
put
you
on
i've
been
searching
for
someone
to
satisfy
my
every
need
won't
you
be
my
inspiration
be
the
real
love
that
i
need
real
love
i'm
searching
for
a
real
love
someone
to
set
my
heart
free
real
love
i'm
searching
for
a
real
love
ooh
when
i
met
you
i
just
knew
that
you
would
take
my
heart
and
run
until
you
told
me
how
you
loved
for
me
you
said
i'm
not
the
one
so
i
slowly
came
to
see
all
of
the
things
that
you
were
made
of
and
now
i
hope
my
dreams
and
inspiration
lead
me
towards
a
real
love

searching
for
a
real
love
i
got
to
have
a
real
love
love
so
true
and
oh
baby
i
thought
that
love
was
you
i
thought
that
you
were
the
answer
to
the
question
in
my
mind
but
it
seems
that
i
was
wrong
if
i
stay
strong
maybe
i'll
find
a
real
love
so
i
try
my
best
and
pray
to
god
he
send
me
someone
real
to
caress
me
and
to
guide
me
towards
a
love

heart
can
feel
now
i
know
i
can
be

can
be
your
all
and

while&quot;
he

a
smile
&quot;what

long
since
retired

moved
away
i
called

up
just
the
other

nice
talkin'
to
you
dad
it's
been
sure
nice
talkin'
to
you&quot;
and
as
i
hung
up
the
phone
it
occurred
to
me
he'd
grown
up
just
like
me
my
boy
was
just
like
me
and
the
cats
in
the
cradle
and
the
silver
spoon
little
boy
blue
and
the
man

time
then&quot;
and
the
cats
in
the
cradle
and
the
silver
spoon
little
boy
blue
and
the
man
on
the

&quot;when
you
comin'
home&quot;
&quot;son
i
don't
know
when&quot;
&quot;we'll
get
together
then&quot;
&quot;you
know
we'll
have
a
good
time
then&quot;
what
about
your
friends
what
about
what
about
your
friends
what
about
what
about
every
now
and
then
i
get
a
little
crazy
that's
not
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be
sometimes
my
vision
is
a
little
hazy
i
can't
tell
who
i
should
trust
or
just
who
i
let
trust
me
people
try
to
say
i
act
a
little
funny
but
that's
just
a
figure
of
speech
to
me
they
tell
me
i
changed
because
i
got
money
but
if
you
were
there
before
then
you're
still
down
with
me
what
about
your
friends
will
they
stand
their
ground
will
they
let
you
down
again
what
about
your
friends
are
they
gonna
be
low
down
will
they
ever
be
around
or
will
they
turn
their
backs
on
you
well
is
it
me
or
can
it
be
i'm
a
little
too
friendly
so
to
speak
hypothetically
say
i
supply
creativity
to
what
others
must
take
as
a
form
of
self-hate
only
to
make
an
enemy
which
results
in
unfortunate
destiny
they
dog
me
out
then
be
next
to
me
just
'cause
i
am
what
some
choose
to
envy
every
now
and
then
i
get
a
little
easy
i
let
a
lot
of
people
depend
on
me
i
never
thought
they
would
ever
deceive
me
don't
you
know
when
times
got
rough
i
was
standing
on
my
own
i'll
never
let
another
get
that
close
to
me
you
see
i've
grown
a
lot
smarter
now
sometimes
you
have
to
choose
and
then
you'll
see
if
your
friends
is
true
they'll
be
there
with
you
through
the
thick
and
thin
what
about
your
friends
will
they
stand
their

lips
are
burning
mine
and
you
take
the
time
to
tell
me
how
you
feel
when
you
listen
to
my
words
and
i
know
you've
heard
i

for
the
first
time
i
can
hear
my

call
me
a
fool
but
i
know
i'm
not
i'm
gonna
stand
out
here
on
the
mountain

feel
it
on
my
finger

hear
it
on
my

away
my
sorrow
take
away
my
pain
your
love's
coming
down

when
you
looked
into
my
eyes
and
you
said
goodbye
could
you
see
my
tears
when
i
turned
the
other
way
did
you
hear
me
say
i'd
wait
for
all
the
dark
clouds
bursting
in
a
perfect
sky
you
promised
me
when
you
said
goodbye
that
you'd
return
when
the
storm
was
done
and

hardest
thing

myself
that

in
you
i
feel
like
i've
known
you
before

my
soul
more
and
more
and
more
that
by
sheer
force
of
will
when
i'm
with
you
i
will
raise
you
from
the
ground
i
feel
like
a
magical
child
and
without
a
sound
you'll
appear
everything
strange
and
surrender
to
me
to
love
everything
wild

mi
angel
i
heard
from
a
friend
today
and
she
said
you
were
in
town
suddenly
the
memories
came
back
to
me
in
my
mind
&quot;how
can
i
be
strong&quot;
i've
asked
myself
time
and
time
i've
said
that
i'll
never
fall
in
love
with
you
again
a
wounded
heart
you
gave
my
soul
you
took
away
good
intentions
you
had
many
i
know
you
did
i've
come
from
a
place
that
hurts
and
god
knows
how
i've
cried
and
i
never
want
to
return
never
fall
again
making
love
to
you
oh
it
felt
so
good
and
oh
so
right
&quot;how
can
i
be
strong&quot;
i've
asked
myself
time
and
time
i've
said
that
i'll
never
fall
in
love
with
you
again
so
here
we
are
alone
again
didn't
think
it'd
come
to
this
and
to
know
it
all
began
with
just
a
little
kiss
i've
come
too
close
to
happiness
to
have
it
swept
away
don't
think
i
can
take
the
pain
never
fall
again
kinda
late
in
the
game
and
my
heart
is
in
your
hands
don't
you
stand
there
and
then
tell
me
you
love
me
then
leave
again
'cause
i'm
falling
in
love
with
you
again
hold
me
hold
me
don't
ever
let
me
go
say
it
just
one
time
say
you
love
me
god
knows
i
do
love
you
again
the
road
i
have
traveled
on
is
paved
with
good
intentions
it's
littered
with
broken
dreams
that
never
quite
came
true
when
all
of
my
hopes
were
dying
her
love
kept
me
trying
she
does
her
best
to
hide
the
pain
that
she's
been
through
when
she
cries
at
night
and
she
doesn't
think
that
i
can
hear
her
she
tries
to
hide
all
the
fear
she
feels
inside
so
i
pray
this
time
i
can
be
the
man
that
she
deserves
'cos
i
die
a
little
each
time
when
she
cries
she's
always
been
there
for
me
whenever
i've
fallen
when
nobody
else
believes
she'll
be
there
by
my
side
i
don't
know
how
she
takes
it
just
once
i'd
like
to
make
it
then
there'll
be
tears
of
joy
that
fill
her
lovin'
eyes
when
she
cries
at
night
and
she
doesn't
think
that
i
can
hear
her
she
tries
to
hide
all
the
fear
she
feels
inside
so
i
pray
this
time
i
can
be
the
man
that
she
deserves
'cos
i
die
a
little
each
time
when
she
cries
so
i
pray
this
time
i
can
be
the

that
she
deserves
'cos

you'll

when

moves
upon

you'll
forget
the
sun
in
his
jealous
sky
as
we
walk
in
fields
of
gold
so
she
took
her
love
for
to
gaze
awhile
upon
the

in

blown
the
whole
thing
years
ago
i
might
be
here
with
you
tomorrow
we
can
drive
around
this
town
and
let
the
cops
chase
us
around
the
past
is
gone
but
something
might
be
found
to
take
its
place...hey
jealousy
tomorrow
we
can
drive
around
this
town
and
let
the
cops
chase
us
around
the
past
is

but
something
might

take
its
place...hey
jealousy
well
tell
me
do
you
think
it'd
be
all
right
if
i
could
just
crash
here
tonight
you
can
see
i'm
in
no
shape
for
driving
and
anyway
i've
got
no
place
to
go
and
you
know
it
might
not
be
that
bad
you
were
the
best
i'd
ever
had
if
i
hadn't
blown
the
whole
thing
years
ago
i
might
not
be
alone
tomorrow
we
can
drive
around
this
town
and
let
the
cops
chase
us
around
the
past
is
gone
but
something
might
be
found
to
take
its
place...hey
jealousy
hey
jealousy
she
took
my
heart
well
there's
only
one
thing
i
couldn't
start
you
could
say
i
lost
my
faith
in
science
and
progress
you
could
say
i
lost
my
belief
in
the
holy
church
you
could
say
i
lost
my
sense
of
direction
you
could
say
all
of
this
and
worse
but
if
i
ever
lose
my
faith
in
you
there'd
be
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
some
would
say
i
was
a
lost
man
in
a
lost
world
you
could
say
i
lost
my
faith
in
the
people
on
tv
you
could
say
i'd
lost
my
belief
in
our
politicians
they
all
seemed
like
game
show
hosts
to
me
if
i
ever
lose
my
faith
in
you
there'd
be
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
i
could
be
lost
inside
their
lies
without
a
trace
but
every
time
i
close
my
eyes
i
see
your
face
i
never
saw
no
miracle
of
science
that
didn't
go
from
a
blessing
to
a
curse
i
never
saw
no
military
solution
that
didn't
always
end
up
as
something
worse
but
let
me
say
this
first
if
i
ever
lose
my
faith
in
you
there'd
be
nothing
left
for
me
