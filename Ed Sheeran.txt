i
found
a
love
for
me
oh
darling
just
dive
right
in
and
follow
my
lead
well
i
found
a
girl
beautiful
and
sweet
oh
i
never
knew
you
were
the
someone
waiting
for
me


'cause
we
were
just
kids
when
we
fell
in
love
not
knowing
what
it
was
i
will
not
give
you
up
this
time
but
darling
just
kiss
me
slow
your
heart
is
all
i
own
and
in
your
eyes
you're
holding
mine

baby
i'm
dancing
in
the
dark
with
you
between
my
arms
barefoot
on
the
grass
listening
to
our
favourite
song
when
you
said
you
looked
a
mess
i
whispered
underneath
my
breath
but
you
heard
it
darling
you
look
perfect
tonight


well
i
found
a
woman
stronger
than
anyone
i
know
she
shares
my
dreams
i
hope
that
someday
i'll
share
her
home
i
found
a
love
to
carry
more
than
just
my
secrets
to
carry
love
to
carry
children
of
our
own


we
are
still
kids
but
we're
so
in
love
fighting
against
all
odds
i
know
we'll
be
alright
this
time
darling
just
hold
my
hand
be
my
girl
i'll
be
your
man
i
see
my
future
in
your
eyes


baby
i'm
dancing
in
the
dark
with
you
between
my
arms
barefoot
on
the
grass
listening
to
our
favourite
song
when
i
saw
you
in
that
dress
looking
so
beautiful
i
don't
deserve
this
darling
you
look
perfect
tonight

might
also
like

i'm

with
you
between
my
arms
barefoot
on
the
grass
listening
to
our
favourite
song
i
have
faith
in
what
i
see
now
i
know
i
have
met
an
angel

when
i
was
six
years
old
i
broke
my
leg
i
was
running
from
my
brother
and
his
friends
and
tasted
the
sweet
perfume
of
the
mountain
grass
i
rolled
down
i
was
younger
then
take
me
back
to
when
i


found
my
heart
and
broke
it
here
made
friends
and
lost
them
through
the
years
and
i've
not
seen
the
roaring
fields
in
so
long
i
know
i've
grown
but
i
can't
wait
to
go
home

i'm
on
my
way
driving
at
90
down
those
country
lanes
singing
to
"tiny
dancer"
and
i
miss
the
way
you
make
me
feel
and
it's
real
we
watched
the
sunset
over
the
castle
on
the
hill


fifteen
years
old
and
smoking
hand-rolled
cigarettes
running
from
the
law
through
the
backfields
and
getting
drunk
with
my
friends
had
my
first
kiss
on
a
friday
night
i
don't
reckon
that
i
did
it
right
but
i
was
younger
then
take
me
back
to
when


we
found
weekend
jobs
when
we
got
paid
we'd
buy
cheap
spirits
and
drink
them
straight
me
and
my
friends
have
not
thrown
up
in
so
long
oh
how
we've
grown
but
i
can't
wait
to
go
home

i'm
thinking
'bout
how
people
fall
in
love
in
mysterious
ways
maybe
just
the
touch
of
a
hand
well
me
i
fall
in
love
with
you
every
single
day
and
i
just
wanna
tell
you
i
am

so
honey
now
take
me
into
your
loving
arms
kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
place
your
head
on
my
beating
heart
i'm
thinking
out
loud
and
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are


when
my
hair's
all
but
gone
and
my
memory
fades
and
the
crowds
don't
remember
my
name
when
my
hands
don't
play
the
strings
the
same
way
i
know
you
will
still
love
me
the
same


'cause
honey
your
soul
could
never
grow
old
it's
evergreen
and
baby
your
smile's
forever
in
my
mind
and
memory
i'm
thinking
'bout
how
people
fall
in
love
in
mysterious
ways
and
maybe
it's
all
part
of
a
plan
well
i'll
just
keep
on
making
the
same
mistakes
hoping
that
you'll
understand


that
baby
now
take
me
into
your
loving
arms
kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand

out
loud
and

also

now
take
me
into
your

lyrics
i
met
this
girl
late
last
year
she
said
"don't
you
worry
if
i
disappear"
i
told
her
i'm
not
really
looking
for
another
mistake
i
called
an
old
friend
thinking
that
the
trouble
would
wait
but
then
i
jumped
right
in
a
week
later
returned
i
reckon
she
was
only
looking
for
a
lover
to
burn
but
i
gave
her
my
time
for
two
or
three
nights
then
i
put
it
on
pause
until
the
moment
was
right
i
went
away
for
months
until
our
paths
crossed
again
she
told
me
"i
was
never
looking
for
a
friend
maybe
you
could
swing
by
my
room
around
ten
baby
bring
the
lemon
and
a
bottle
of
gin
we'll
be
in
between
the
sheets
till
the
late
am"
baby
if
you
wanted
me
then
you
should
have
just
said
she's
singing

don't

with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all
over
my
home
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
don't

with
my
love
i
told
her
she
knows
take
aim
and
reload
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe


and
for
a
couple
weeks
i
only
wanna
see
her
we
drink
away
the
days
with
a
takeaway
pizza
before
a
text
message
was
the
only
way
to
reach
her
now
she's
staying
at
my
place
and
loves
the
way
i
treat
her
singing
out
aretha
all
over
the
track
like
a
feature
and
never
wants
to
sleep
i
guess
that
i
don't
want
to
either
but
me
and
her
we
make
money
the
same
way
four
cities
two
planes
the
same
day
and
those
shows
have
never
been
what
it's
about
but
maybe
we'll
go
together
and
just
figure
it
out
i'd
rather
put
on
a
film
with
you
and
sit
on
a
couch
but
we
should
get
on
a
plane
or
we'll
be
missing
it
now
wish
i'd
have
written
it
down
the
way
that
things
played
out
when
she
was
kissing
him
how
i
was
confused
about
now
she
should
figure
it
out
while
i'm
sat
here
singing
you
might
also
like
don't

with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all
over
my
home
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
don't

with
my
love
i
told
her
she
knows
take
aim
and
reload
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe



on
my
hotel
door
i
don't
even
know
if
she
knows
what
for
she
was
crying
on
my
shoulder
i
already
told
ya
trust
and
respect
is
what
we
do
this
for
i
never
intended
to
be
next

but
you
didn't
need
to
take
him
to
bed
that's
all
and
i
never
saw
him
as
a
threat

until
you
disappeared
with
him
to
have
sex
of
course
it's
not
like
we
were
both
on
tour
we
were
staying
on
the
same

hotel
floor
and
i
wasn't
looking
for
a
promise
or
commitment
but
it
was
never
just
fun
and
i
thought
you
were
different
this
is
not
the
way
you
realized
what
you
wanted
it's
a
bit
too
much
too
late
if
i'm
honest
and
all
this
time
god
knows
i'm
singing

don't

lyrics
i
was
born
inside
a
small
town
i
lost
that
state
of
mind
learned
to
sing
inside
the
lord's
house
but
stopped
the
age
of
nine
i
forget
when
i
get
awards
now
the
wave
i
had
to
ride
the
paving
stones
i
played
upon
that
kept
me
on
the
grind
so
blame
it
on
the
pain
that
blessed
me
with
the
life
friends
and
family
filled
with
envy
when
they
should
be
filled
with
pride
and
when
the
world's
against
me
is
when
i
really
come
alive
and
every
day
that
satan
tempts
me
i
try
to
take
it
in
my
stride
you
know
that
i've
got
whisky
with
white
lies
and
smoke
in
my
lungs
i
think
life
has
got
to
the
point
i
know
without
it's
no
fun
i
need
to
get
in
the
right
mind
and
clear
myself
up
instead
i
look
in
the
mirror
questioning
what
i've
become
guess
it's
a
stereotypical
day
for
someone
like
me
without
a
nine-to-five
job
or
a
uni
degree
to
be
caught
up
in
the
trappings
of
the
industry
show
me
the
locked
doors
i'll
find
another
use
for
the
key
and
you'll
see

i'm
well
aware
of
certain
things
that
can
destroy
a
man
like
me
but
with
that
said
give
me
one
more


another
one
to
take
the
sting
away
i
am
happy
on
my
own
so
here
i'll
stay
save
your
lovin'
arms
for
a
rainy
day
and
i'll
find
comfort
in
my
pain
eraser


i
used
to
think
that
nothing
could
be
better
than
touring
the
world
with
my
songs
i
chased
the
pictured
perfect
life
i
think
they
painted
it
wrong
i
think
that
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
and
fame
is
hell
relationships
and
hearts
you
fixed
they
break
as
well
and
ain't
nobody
wanna
see
you
down
in
the
dumps
because
you're
living
your
dream
man
this
shit
should
be
fun
please
know

i'm

rents
a
house
in

wears
a

bag
on

drinks

has
a

i'm
