itxe2x80x99s
been
shitty

feel
awkward
as
i
should
this
club
has
got
to
be
the
most
pretentious
thing
since
i
thought
you
and
me
well
i
am
imagining
a
dark
lit
place
or
your
place
or
my
place
well
ixe2x80x99m
not
paralyzed
but
i
seem
to
be
struck
by
you
i
want
to
make
you
move
because
youxe2x80x99re
standing
still
if
your
body
matches
what
your
eyes
can
do
youxe2x80x99ll
probably
move
right
through
me
on
my
way

you
i
hold
out
for
one
more
drink
before
i
think
ixe2x80x99m
looking
too
desperately
but
so
far
has
not
been
fun
i
should
just
stay
home
if
one
thing
really
means
one
this
club
will
hopefully
be
closed
in
three
weeks
that
would
be
cool
with
me
well
ixe2x80x99m
still
imagining

no
better
reason

rid
yourself
of
vanities

is
our
virtue

won't
hesitate

on

not
about
taking
sides
when
i
looked
in
the
mirror
didn't
deliver
it
hurt
enough
to
think
that
i
could
stop
admit
that
i'm
wrong
and
then
change
my
mind
sorry
but
i
gotta
be
strong
and
leave
you
behind

i
must
have
known
you
in
another

i
fake
a

so
he
won't
see
that
i
want
and
i'm
needing
everything
that
we
should
be
i'll
bet
she's
beautiful
that
girl
he
talks
about
and
she's
got
everything
that
i
have
to
live
without
drew
talks
to
me
i
laugh
'cause
it's
just
so
funny
that
i
can't
even
see
anyone
when
he's
with
me
he
says
he's
so
in
love
he's
finally
got
it
right
i
wonder
if
he
knows
he's
all
i
think
about
at
night
he's
the
reason
for
the
teardrops
on
my
guitar
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
wishing
on
a
wishing
star
he's
the
song
in
the
car
i
keep
singing.
don't
know
why
i
do
drew
walks
by
me
can
he
tell
that
i
can't
breathe
and
there
he
goes
so
perfectly
the
kind
of
flawless
i
wish
i
could
be
she'd
better
hold
him
tight
give
him
all
her
love
look
in
those
beautiful
eyes
and
know
she's
lucky
'cause
he's
the
reason
for
the
teardrops
on
my
guitar
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
wishing
on
a
wishing
star
he's
the
song
in
the
car
i
keep
singing.
don't
know
why
i
do
so
i
drive
home
alone
as
i
turn
out
the
light
i'll
put
his
picture
down
and
maybe
get
some
sleep
tonight
'cause
he's
the
reason
for
the
teardrops
on
my
guitar
the
only
one
who's
got
enough
of
me
to
break
my
heart
he's
the
song
in
the
car
i
keep
singing.
don't
know
why
i
do
he's
the
time
taken
up
but
there's
never
enough
and
he's
all
that
i
need
to
fall
into
drew
looks
at
me
i
fake
a
smile
so
he
won't
see
boys
call
you
sexy
what's
up
sexy
and
you
don't
care
what
they
say

everytime
you
turn
around
they
scream
your
name
boys

we
were
both
young
when
i
first
saw
you
i
close
my
eyes
and
the
flashback
starts:
i'm
standing
there
on
a
balcony
in
summer
air
see
the
lights
see
the
party
the
ball
gowns
see
you
make
your
way
through
the
crowd
and
say
&quot;hello.&quot;
little
did
i
know
that
you
were
romeo
you
were
throwing
pebbles
and
my
daddy
said
&quot;stay
away
from
juliet.&quot;
and
i
was
crying
on
the
staircase
begging
you
&quot;please
don't
go.&quot;
and
i
said
&quot;romeo
take
me
somewhere
we
can
be
alone
i'll
be
waiting.
all
there's
left
to
do
is
run
you'll
be
the
prince
and
i'll
be
the
princess
it's
a
love
story.
baby
just
say
'yes'.&quot;
so
i
sneak
out
to
the
garden
to
see
you
we
keep
quiet
'cause
we're
dead
if
they
knew
so
close
your
eyes
escape
this
town
for
a
little
while
oh
oh
'cause
you
were
romeo.
i
was
a
scarlet
letter
and
my
daddy
said
&quot;stay
away
from
juliet.&quot;
but
you
were
everything
to
me
i
was
begging
you
&quot;please
don't
go&quot;
and
i
said
&quot;romeo
take
me
somewhere
we
can
be
alone
i'll
be
waiting.
all
there's
left
to
do
is
run
you'll
be
the
prince
and
i'll
be
the
princess
it's
a
love
story.
baby
just
say
'yes'
romeo
save
me.
they're
trying
to
tell
me
how
to
feel
this
love
is
difficult
but
it's
real
don't
be
afraid.
we'll
make
it
out
of
this
mess
it's
a
love
story.
baby
just
say
'yes'.&quot;
oh
oh
oh
i
got
tired
of
waiting
wondering
if
you
were
ever
coming
around
my
faith
in
you
was
fading
when
i
met
you
on
the
outskirts
of
town
and
i
said
&quot;romeo
save
me.
i've
been
feeling
so
alone
i
keep
waiting
for
you
but
you
never
come
is
this
in
my
head
i
don't
know
what
to
think.&quot;

knelt
to
the
ground
and
pulled
out
a
ring
and
said
&quot;marry
me
juliet.

never
have
to
be
alone
i
love
you

1989
my
thoughts
were
short
my
hair
was
long
caught
somewhere
between
a
boy
and
man
she
was
seventeen
and
she
was
far
from
in-between
it
was
summertime
in
northern
michigan
splashing
through
the
sand
bar
talking
by
the
campfire
it's
the
simple
things
in
life
like
when
and
where
we
didn't
have
no
internet
but
man
i
never
will
forget
the
way
the
moonlight
shined
upon
her
hair
and
we
were
trying
different
things
we
were
smoking
funny
things
making
love
out
by
the
lake
to
our
favorite
song
sipping
whiskey
out
the

'bout

catching
walleye
from
the

the
waves
roll
off
the
rocks
she'll
forever
hold
a
spot
inside
my
soul
we'd
blister
in
the
sun
we
couldn't

for
night
to
come
to
hit

i
hate
the
most
that

you
it's
awkward
and
silent
as
i
wait
for
you
to
say
but
what
i
need
to
hear
now
is
your
sincere
apology
when
you
mean
it
i'll
believe
it
if
you
text
it
i'll
delete
it

i
hate
the
most
that
you
do
you
make
me
love
you
and
compared
to
all
the
great
things
that
would
take
too

to
write
i
probably
should
mention
the

both
i'll
have
to
buy
your
hand
in
mine

we're
intertwined
everything's
alright
i
want
to
be
with

a
gift
from
the

it

easy
to
tell
it
was
love
from
above
that
could
save
me
from
hell
she
had
fire
in
her
soul
it
was
easy
to
see
how
the
devil
himself
could
be
pulled
out
of
me
there
were
drums
in
the
air
as
she
started
to
dance
every
soul
in
the
room
keeping
time
with
their
hands
and
we
sang...
ay
oh
ay
oh
ay
oh

voices
rang

the
angels
sing
we're
singing...

ay
oh
ay
and
we
danced

into
the
night

oh
ay
oh
ay
oh
ay
oh
and
we
danced
on
into
the
night
like
a
piece
to
the
puzzle
that
falls
into
place
you
could
tell
how
we
felt
from
the
look
on
our
faces
we
were
spinning
in
circles
with
the
moon
in
our
eyes
no
room
left
to
move
in
between
you
and
i
we
forgot
where
we
were
and
we
lost
track
of
time
and
we
sang
to
the
wind
as
we
danced
through
the
night
and
we
sang...
ay
oh
ay
oh
ay
oh

the
voices
rang
like
the
angels
sing
we're
singing...

a
gift
from
the
heavens
it
was
easy
to
tell
it
was
love
from
above
that
could
save
me
from
hell
she
had
fire
in
her
soul
it
was
easy
to
see
how
the
devil
himself
could
be
pulled
out
of
me
there
were
drums
in
the
air
as
she
started
to
dance
every
soul
in
the
room
keeping
time
with
their
hands

we
sang...

heard
it
all
before

you

let
you
walk
away
and
you
can't
help
who
you
love

you
find
yourself
giving
it
away
