felt
more
free
tell
your
friends
that
you're

i
hope
she
comes
along
and
wrecks
every
one
of
your
plans
i
hope
you
spend
your
last
dime
to
put
a
rock
on
her
hand
i
hope
she's
wilder
than

her
on
a
first
date
again

that's
all
i
plan
to
do
i
had
a
dream
i
got
everything
i
wanted
not
what
you'd
think
and
if
i'm
being
honest
it
might
have
been
a
nightmare
to
anyone
who
might
care
thought
i
could
fly
so
i
stepped
off
the
golden
nobody
cried
nobody
even
noticed
i
saw
them
standing
right
there
kinda
thought
they
might
care
i
had
a
dream
i
got
everything
i
wanted
but
when
i
wake
up
i
see
you
with
me
and
you
say
as
long
as
i'm
here
no
one
can
hurt
you
don't
wanna
lie
here
but
you
can
learn
to
if
i
could
change
the
way
that
you
see
yourself
you
wouldn't
wonder
why
you
hear
&quot;they
don't
deserve
you&quot;
i
tried
to
scream
but
my
head
was
under
water
they
called
me
weak
like
i'm
not
just
somebody's
daughter
could've
been
a
nightmare
but
it
felt
like
they
were
right
there
and
it
feels
like
yesterday
was
a
year
ago
but
i
don't
wanna
let
anybody
know
'cause
everybody
wants
something
from
me
now
and
i
don't
wanna
let
'em
down
i
had
a
dream
i
got
everything
i
wanted
but
when
i
wake
up
i
see
you

i
hate
you
but
i
was
just
kidding
myself
our
every
moment
i
start
to
replace
'cause
now
that
they're
gone
all
i
hear
are
the
words
that
i
needed
to
say
when
you
hurt
under
the
surface
like
troubled
water
running
cold
well
time
can
heal
but
this
won't
so
before
you
go
was
there
something
i
could've
said
to
make
your
heart
beat
better
if
only
i'd
have
known
you
had
a
storm
to
weather
so
before
you
go
was
there
something
i
could've
said
to
make
it
all
stop
hurting
it
kills
me
how
your
mind
can
make
you
feel
so
worthless
so
before
you
go
was
never
the
right
time
whenever
you
called
went
little
by
little
by
little
until
there
was
nothing
at
all
our
every
moment
i
start
to
replay
but
all
i
can
think
about
is
seeing
that
look
on
your
face
when
you
hurt
under
the
surface
like
troubled
water
running
cold
well
time
can
heal
but
this
won't
so
before

it
kills
me
how
your
mind
can
make
you
feel
so
worthless
so
before
you
go
would
we
be
better
off
by
now
if
i'd
have
let
my
walls
come
down
maybe
i
guess
we'll
never
know
you
know
you
know
before
you
go
was
there
something
i

just
don't

let's
be
for
real
if
it
wasn't
for
the

if
i
keep
taking
these

to
pieces
i
really
think
i

them
i
stopped
taking
the
drugs
and
now
the

me
softly
lauryn
hill
sometimes
i
don't
know
how
to
feel
i
was
a
third-string
dreamer
on
a
second-place
team
but
i
was
hell
on
wheels
with
a
full
head
of
steam
when
coach
put
me
in
and
i'm
still
proud
of
that
hit
i
was
a
last
resort
to
go
to
prom
with
the
queen
thanks
to
an
ex-boyfriend
who
broke
her
heart
that
week
no
i
didn't
get
lucky
but
i
still
felt
like
a
king
and
that
might
not
mean
much
to
you
but
it
does
to
me
so
say
i'm
a
middle
of
the
road
not
much
to
show
underachieving
average
joe
but
i'm
a
hell
of
a
lover
a
damn
good
brother
and
i
wear
this
heart
on
my
sleeve
and
that
might
not
mean
much
to
you
but
it
does
to
me
i
was
the
one
phone
call
when
my
brother
went
to
jail
pawned
my
guitar
just
to
pay
his
bail
no
i'll
never
get
it
back
but
i'm
okay
with
that
i
was
the
first
man
standing
next
to
my
best
friend
the
day
the
love
of
his
life
said
&quot;i
do&quot;
to
him
i
was
a
couple
beers
deep
but
i
still
remembered
that
speech
and
that
might
not
mean
much
to
you
but
it
does
to
me
so
say
i'm
a
middle
of
the
road
not
much
to
show
underachieving
average
joe
but
i'm
a
hell
of
a
lover
a
damn
good
brother
and
i
wear
this
heart
on
my
sleeve
and
that
might
not
mean
much
to
you
but
it
does
to
me
there's
a
worn-out
blade
that
my
granddaddy
gave
me
my
mama's
first
bible
daddy's
don
williams
vinyl
that
first-fish-catching
zebco
thirty-three
well
that
might
not
mean
much
to
you
but
it
does
to
me
so
say
i'm

and
i'm
a
damn
hard
working
one
thing's
for
certain
i
stand
up
for
what
i
believe
that
might
not
mean
much
to
you
but
it
does
to
me
yeah
it
does
to
me
that
might
not
mean
much
to
you
but
it
does
to
me
oh
it
does
to
me

we
the

to
settle
down
plant
a

roots
real
deep
and
let

but
we
can't

spinnin'
us
your

love
you
more
than
a
california
sunset
more
than
a
beer
when
you
ain't
twenty-one
yet
more
than
a
sunday
morning
lord
turnin'
some
poor
lost
soul
found
hallelujah
bound
yeah
i
love
you
more
than
the
feeling
when
the
bass
hits
the
hook
when
the
guy
gets
the
girl
at
the
end
of
the
book
but
baby
this
might
be
the
last
time
i
get
to
lay
you
down
'cause
i
can't
love
you
more
than
my

i
ain't
the
runaway
kind
i
can't
