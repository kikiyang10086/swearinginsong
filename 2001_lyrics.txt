it's
been
awhile
since

could
hold
my
head
up
high
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
first
saw
you
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
could
stand
on
my
own
two
feet
again
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
could
call
you
and
everything
i
can't
remember
as
fucked
up
as
it
all
may
seem
the
consequences
that
are
rendered
i've
stretched
myself
beyond
my
means
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
could
say
that
i
wasn't
addicted
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
could
say
i
love
myself
as
well
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i've
gone
and
fucked
things
up
just
like
i
always
do
and
it's
been
awhile
but
all
that
shit
seems
to
disappear
when
i'm
with
you
and
everything
i
can't
remember
as
fucked
up
as
it
all
may
seem
the
consequences
that
i've
rendered
i've
gone
and
fucked
things
up
again
again
why
must
i
feel
this
way
just
make
this
go
away
just
one
more
peaceful
day
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
could
look
at
myself
straight
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
said
i'm
sorry
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i've
seen
the
way
the
candles
light
your
face
and
it's
been
awhile
but
i
can
still
remember
just
the
way
you
taste
and
everything
i
can't
remember
as
fucked
up
as
it
all
may
seem
to
be
i
know
it's
me
i
cannot
blame
this
on
my
father
he
did
the
best
he
could
for
me
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
could
hold
my
head
up
high
and
it's
been
awhile
since
i
said
i'm
sorry
yo
i
ain't
seen
you
in
a
minute
but
i
got
something
to
tell
you
listen
see
the
thing
about
you
that
caught
my
eye
is
the
same
thing
that
makes
me
change
my
mind
kind
of
hard
to
explain
but
girl
i'll
try
you
need
to
sit
down
this
may
take
a
while
see
this
girl
she
sort
of
looks
just
like
you
she
even
smiles
just
the
way
you
do
so
innocent
she
seemed
but
i
was
fooled
i'm
reminded
when
i
look
at
you
you
remind
me
of
a
girl
that
i
once
knew
see
her
face
whenever
i
i
look
at
you
you
won't
believe
all
of
the
things
she
put
me
through
this
is
why
i
just
can't
get
with
you
thought
that
she
was
the
one
for
me
'til
i
found
out
she
was
on
her
creep
ooh
she
was
sexing
everyone
but
me
this
is
why
we
could
never
be
you
remind
me
of
a
girl
that
i
once
knew
see
her
face
whenever
i
i
look
at
you
you
won't
believe
all
of
the
things
she
put
me
through
this
is
why
i
just
can't
get
with
you
i
know
it's

i'm
not
the
reason
that
you
go
astray

be
all
right

you
don't
ask
me
to
stay

be
the

at
night
and

leave
i
can
guarantee
you
won't
find
nobody
else
like
me
you
don't
know
how
you
met
me
you
don't
know
why
you
can't
turn
around
and
say
goodbye
all
you
know
is
when
i'm
with
you
i
make
you
free
and
swim
through
your
veins
like
a
fish
in
the
sea
i'm
singin'
follow
me
everything
is
alright
i'll
be
the
one
to
tuck
you
in
at
night

i
can
guarantee
you
won't
find
nobody
else
like
me
sometimes
i
feel
the
fear
of
uncertainty
stinging
clear
and
i
i
can't
help
but
ask
myself
how
much
i
let
the
fear
take
the
wheel
and
steer
it's
driven
me
before
and
it
seems
to
have
a
vague
haunting
mass
appeal
but
lately
i'm
beginning
to
find
that
i
should
be
the
one
behind
the
wheel
whatever
tomorrow
brings
i'll
be
there
with
open
arms
and
open
eyes
yeah
whatever
tomorrow
brings
i'll
be
there
i'll
be
there
so
if
i
decide
to
waiver
my
chance
to
be
one
of
the
hive
will
i
choose
water
over
wine
and
hold
my
own
and
drive
oh
it's
driven
me
before
and
it
seems
to
be
the
way
that
everyone
else
gets
around
but
lately
i'm
beginning
to
find
that
when
i
drive
myself
my
light
is
found
whatever
tomorrow
brings
i'll
be
there
with
open
arms
and
open
eyes
yeah
whatever
tomorrow
brings
i'll
be
there
i'll
be
there
would
you
choose
water
over
wine
hold
the
wheel
and
drive
whatever
tomorrow
brings
i'll
be
there
with
open
arms
and
open
eyes
yeah
whatever
tomorrow
brings
i'll
be
there
i'll

this
real
wild
party
they
had
the
liquor
overflowin'
the
cup
about
5-6
strippers
trying
to
work
for
a
buck
and
i
took
one
girl
outside
with
me
her
name
was
lonnie
she
went
to
junior
high
with
me
i
said
&quot;why

for
cash
i
guess
a
whole
lot's
changed
since

seen
you
last.&quot;
she
said
&quot;what
would
you
do
if
your
son
was
at
home
crying
all
alone
on
the
bedroom
floor
'cause
he's
hungry
and
the
only
way
to
feed
him
is
to
sleep
with
a
man
for
a
little
bit
of
money
and
his
daddy's
gone
somewhere
smokin'

she
looked
me
right
square
in
the
eye
and
said
&quot;everyday
i
wake
up
hopin'
to

she
said
&quot;nigga

time
you'd

it's
over
over.
it's
not
the
way
i
choose
to

something
somewhere's
got
to

as
sharing
this
relationship
gets
older
older.
you
know
i'd
fight
for
you

how
could
i
fight
someone
who
isn't

had
the
rest
of
you
now

not
fair.

are
times

feel
it
in
my
heart
but
i

times
you
look
at
me

i'm
all
that
you
can
see.

times
i
don't
believe
it's
right.

make
me
promises

did
know
how
to
keep
them
well.

had
the
rest
of
you
now
i
want
the
best
of
you.

show
and
tell.

regret
from
yesterday
that
just
seems
to
grow
with
time
there's
no
use
looking
back
or
wondering
how
it
could
be
now
or
might
have
been
all
this
i
know
but
still
i
can't
find
ways
to
let
you
go
i've
never
had
a
dream
come
true
till
the
day
that
i

you
even

i've
moved
on
you'll
always
be

takes
me
to
a

me
will
always
be
with
you
somewhere
in
my
memory
i've
lost
all
sense
of
time
and
tomorrow
can
never
be
cause
yesterday
is
all
that
fills
my

where
life
takes
me
to
a
part
of
me
will
always
be
a
part
of
me
will
always
be
with
you
i
don't
understand
you
look
just
like
the
man
in
the
picture
by
our
bed
the
suspence
is
pounding
and
clouding
up
my
head
i'm
checkin'
your
clothes
and
you
wear
the
same
size
shoe
you
sleep
in
his
spot
and
you're
driving
his
car
but
i
don't
know
just
who
you
are
there's
a
stranger
in
my
house
it
took
a
while
to
figure
out
there's
no
way
you
could
be
who
you
say
you
are
you
gotta
be
someone
else
cuz
he
wouldn't
touch
me
like
that
and
he
wouldn't
treat
me
like
you
do
he
would
adore
me
he
wouldn't
ignore
me
so
i'm
convinced
there's
a
stranger
in
my
house
i'm
not
sure
who
you
are
don't
see
your
shadow
around
when
you
walk
ain't
leavin'
no
kisses
goodbye
with
no
words
if
these
walls
could
talk
they
would
have
nothing
to
tell
so
what
could
it
be
is
there
someone
immitating
me
could
she
be
taking
my
place
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
me
that
i'm
wrong
when
i
say...
there's
a
stranger
in
my
house
it
took
a
while
to
figure
out
there's
no
way
you
could
be
who
you
say
you
are
you
gotta
be
someone
else
cuz
he
wouldn't
touch
me
like
that
and
he
wouldn't
treat
me
like
you
do
he
would
adore
me
he
wouldn't
ignore
me
so
i'm
convinced
there's
a
stranger
in
my
house
pop
quiz
tell
me
where
we
first
kissed
tell
me
where
my
spot
is
tell
me
if
i
liked
it
loved
it
or
could
it
be
that
the
stranger
is
me
have
i
changed
so
drastically
is
it
i
want
more
for
me
and
you

same
there's

could
squeeze
me
but
i
got
all
the
time
for
you
love
the
space
between
the
tears
we
cry
is
the
laughter
keeps
us
coming
back
for
more
the
space
between
the
wicked
lies
we
tell
and
hope
to
keep
safe
from
the
pain
but
will
i
hold
you
again
these
fickle
fuddled
words
confuse
me
like
'will
it
rain
today'
waste
the
hours
with
talking
talking
these
twisted
games
we're
playing
we're
strange
allies
with
warring
hearts
what
wild-eyed
beast
you
be
the
space
between
the
wicked
lies
we
tell
and
hope
to
keep
safe
from
the
pain
will
i
hold
you
again
will
i
hold...
look
at
us
spinning
out
in
the
madness
of
a
roller
coaster
you
know
you
went
off
like
a
devil
in
a
church
in
the
middle
of
a
crowded
room
all
we
can
do
my
love
is
hope
we
don't
take
this
ship
down
the
space
between
where
you're
smiling
high
is
where
you'll
find
me
if
i
get
to
go
the
space
between
the
bullets
in
our
firefight
is
where
i'll
be
hiding
waiting
for
you
the
rain
that
falls
splash
in
your
heart
ran
like
sadness
down
the
window
into...
the
space
between
our
wicked
lies
is
where
we
hope
to
keep
safe
from
pain
take
my
hand
'cause
we're
walking
out
of
here
oh
right
out
of
here
love
is
all
we
need
here
the
space
between
what's
wrong
and
right
is
where
you'll
find
me
hiding
waiting
for
you
the
space
between
your
heart
and
mine
is
the
space
we'll
fill
with
time
the
space
between...
when
i
think
back
on
these
times
and
the
dreams

love
so
many
things
i've
got
to
tell
you
but
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know
how
'cause
there's
a
possibility
that
you'll
look
at
me
differently
love
ever
since
the
first
moment
i
spoke
your
name
from
then
on
i
knew
that
by
you
being
in
my
life
things
were
destined
to
change
'cause...
[hook:]
love
so
many
people
use
your
name
in
vain
love
those
who
have
faith
in
you
sometimes
go
astray

through
all
the
ups
and
downs
the
joys

for
better

she

to
clear
her
mind
he
figured
she'd
gone

to
austin
'cause
she
talked
about
it
all
the
time
it
was
almost
a
year
before
she
called
him
up
three
rings
and
an
answering
machine
is
what
she
got
if
you're
callin'
'bout

you
the
telephone
fell
to
the
counter
she
heard
but
she
couldn't
believe
what
kind
of
man
would
hang
on
that
long
what
kind
of
love
that
must
be
she
waited
three
days
and
then
she
tried
again
she
didn't
know
what
she'd
say
but
she
heard
three
rings
and
then
if
it's
friday
night
i'm
at
the
ballgame
and
first
thing
saturday
if
it
don't
rain
i'm

but
i'll
call
you
back
when
i
get
home
on
sunday
afternoon
and
p.s.
if
this
is
austin
i
still
love
you
well
this
time
she
left
her
number
but
not
another
word
then
she
waited
by
the
phone
on
sunday
evenin'
and
this
is
what
he
heard
if
you're
callin'
'bout
my
heart
it's
still
yours
i
should've
listened
to
it
a
little
more
then
it
wouldn't
have
taken
me
so
long
to
know
where
i

by
the
way

i
pulled
into
the
shopping
center
and
saw
a
little
boy
wrapped
around
the
legs
of
his
mother
like
ice
cream
melting
they
embraced
years
of
bad
decisions
runnin'
down
her
face
all
mornin'
i'd
been
thinkin'
my
life's
so
hard
and
they
wore
everything
they
own
livin'
in
a
car
i
wanted
to
tell
him
it
would
be
ok
but
i
got
just
got
in
my
suburban
and
i
drove
away
but
i
don't
know
why
they
say
grown
men
don't
cry
i
don't
know
why
they
say
grown
men
don't
cry
keep
having
this
dream
about
my
old
man
i'm
10
years
old
and
he's
holding
my
hand
we're
talkin'
on
the
front
porch
watchin'
the
sun
go
down
but
it
was
just
a
dream
he
was
a
slave
to
his
job
and
he
couldn't
be
around
so
many
things
i
wanna
say
to
him
but
i
just
placed
a
rose
on
his
grave
and
i
talk
to
the
wind
but
i
don't
know
why
they
say
grown
men
don't
cry
i
don't
know
why
they
say
grown
men
don't
cry
don't
cry
i'm
sittin'
here
with
my
kids
and
my
wife
and
everything
that
i
hold
dear
in
my
life
we
say
grace
and
thank
the
lord
got
so
much
to
be
thankful
for
then
it's
up
the
stairs
and
off
to

and
my
little

says
&quot;i
haven't

that
your
baby

ain't
doing
so
tough
and
even
though
you
passed
going
on
four
long
years
still
waking
up
late
at
night
crying
tears
just
thinking
about
those
days
you
used
to
talk
to
me
smilin'
while
i'm
sippin'
on
this
hennesy
and
remember
we
bragged
on
how
rich
we
would
be
to
get
up
out
this
hood
was
like
a
fantasy
[1]
and
now
you
hear
my
songs
the
radio
is
playin'
oh
i
can't
believe
my
ears
and
what
everybody's
sayin'
and
boy
i'll
tell
you
folks
don't
know
the
half
i
would
give
it
all
up
just
to
take
one
ride
with
you
how
i
used
to
kick
it
on
the
front
porch
with
you
and
how
i
used
to
lay
back
and
smoke
weed
with
you
and
all
the
little
basement
party
joints
we'd
do
now
i'm
just
missing
you
how
i
wish
[2]
i
wish
that
i
could
hold
you
now
i
wish
that
i
could
touch
you
now
i
wish
that
i
could
talk
to
you
be
with
you
somehow
i
know
you're
in
a
better
place
even
though
i
can't
see
your
face
i
know
you're
smiling
down
on
me
saying
everything's
okay
and
if
i
make
it
out
this
thug
life
i'll
see
you
again
someday
i
wish
i
wish
i
wish
i
wish
i
wish
i
wish
now
ever
since
this
money
come
been
nothing
but
stress
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
trade
in
my
success
y'all
look
at
me
and
say
boy
you've
been
blessed
but
y'all
don't
see
the
inside
of
my
unhappiness
man
i
swear
this
shit
gets
heavy
like
a
ton
that's
why
you
hear
me
shootin'
this
real
shit
off
like
a
gun
hmm
i
wonder
how
my
friends
would
treat
me
now
if
i
wasn't
iced
up
with
a
bentley
and
a
house
that's
why
fake
ass
niggas
get
fake
ass
digits
and
fake
ass
players
get
a
real
player
hatin'
'em
honey
love
goes
platinum
and
y'all
ass
come
around
but
y'all
don't
wanna
raise
the
roof
until
my
shit
is
going
down
[repeat

with
you
how
i
used
to
hoop
off
in
them
tournaments
with
you
and
how
i
used
to
club
hop
on
weekends
with
you
your
family
called
the
morning
of
the
tragic
end
damn
my
condolensces
[repeat
2]
voices
in
my
head
be
telling
me
to
come
to
church
saying
the
lord
is
the
only
way
for
you
to
stop
the
hurt
dreaming
of
windows
black
tinted
like
a
hearse
when
waking
up
to
life
sometimes
seems
worst
and
all
i
ever
wanted
is
to
be
a
better
man
and
i
try
to
keep
it
real
with
my
homies
land
for
me
to
save
the
world
i
don't
understand
how
did
i
become
the
leader
of
a
billion
fans
[repeat
1]
with
you
how
i
used
to
street
perform
on
friday
with
you
and
how
i
used
to
go
to
church
on
easter
sunday
with
you
instead
of
you
all
throwing
them
stones
at
me
somebody
pray
for
me
[repeat
2
till
end]
i
got
rice
cookin'
in
the
microwave
got
a
three
day
beard
i
don't
plan
to
shave
and
it's
a
goofy
thing
but
i
just
gotta
say
hey
i'm
doin'
alright
yeah
i
think
i'll
make
me
some
homemade
soup
i'm
feelin'
pretty
good
and
that's
the
truth
it's
neither
drink
nor
drug
induced
no
i'm
just
doin'
alright
and
it's
a
great
day
to
be
alive
i
know
the
sun's
still
shinin'when
i
close
my
eyes
there's
some
hard
times
in
the
neighborhood
but
why
can't
everyday
be
just
this
good
it's
been
15
years
since
i
left
home
and
said
good
luck
to
every
seed
i'd
sown
gave
it
my
best
and
then
i
left
it
alone
i
hope
they're
doin'
alright
now
i
look
in
the
mirror
and
what
do
i
see
a
lone
wolf
there
starin'
back
at
me
long
in
the
tooth
but
harmless
as
can
be
lord
i
guess
he's
doin'
alright
and
it's
a
great
day

be
just
this
good
sometimes
it's
lonely
sometimes
it's
only
me
and
the
shadows
that
fill
this
room
sometimes
i'm
fallin'
desperately
callin'
howlin'
at
the
moon
ah-ooh
well
i
might
go
get
me
a
new
tattoo
or
take
my
old
harley
for
a
three
day
cruise
might
even
grow
me
a
fu
manchu
and
it's
a
great
day
to
be
alive
i

when
i

shot
right
through
me
my
heart
skipped
a
beat
in
time
there's
a
different
feel
about
you
tonight
it's
got
me
thinkin'
lots
of
crazy
things
i
even
think
i
saw
a
flash
of
light
it
felt
like
electricity
you
shouldn't
kiss
me
like
this
unless
you
mean
it
like
that
cause
i'll
just
close
my
eyes
and
i
won't
know
where
i'm
at
we'll
get
lost
on
this
dance
floor
spinnin'
around
and
around
and
around
and
around
they're
all
watchin'
us
now
they
think
we're
falling
in

they'd
never
believe
we're
just
friends
when
you
kiss
me
like
this
i
think
you
mean
it
like
that
if
you
do
baby
kiss
me
again
everybody
swears
we
make
the
perfect
pair
but
dancing
is
as
far
as
it
goes
girl
you've
never
moved
me
quite
the
way
you
moved
me
tonight
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
you
shouldn't
kiss
me
like
this
unless
you

as
they
pass
and
all
she
wants
is
just
a
little
piece
of
this
dream
is
that
too
much
to
ask
with
a
safe
home
and
a
warm
bed
on
a
quiet
little
street
all
she
wants
is
just
that
something
to
hold
onto
that's
all
she
needs
