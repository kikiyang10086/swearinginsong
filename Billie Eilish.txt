don't

that
you
showed
up
on

i'd
have
an
empty

'cause
you
never
did
never
paid
any
mind
to
my
mother
or
friends
so
i
shut
'em
all
out
for
you
'cause
i
was
a
kid


you
ruined
everything
good
always
said
you
were
misunderstood
made
all
my

just
fuckin'
leave
