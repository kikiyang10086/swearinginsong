again
i

ixe2x80x99m
ok
but
thatxe2x80x99s
not
what
gets
me
what
hurts
the
most
was
being
so
close
and
having
so
much
to
say
and
watching
you
walk
away
and
never

what

have
been
and
not

loving

what
i
was

with
the

ixe2x80x99m
doinxe2x80x99
it
itxe2x80x99s

force
that

when
i

ixe2x80x99m
alone
still
harder
getting
up
getting

livinxe2x80x99
with
this

i
know
if
i
could
do
it
over
i
would
trade
give
away
all
the
words
that
i
saved
in
my
heart
that
i
left
unspoken
what

what
i
was
trying

do
story
of
my
life
searching
for
the
right
but
it
keeps
avoiding
me
sorrow
in
my
soul
'cause
it
seems
that
wrong
really
loves
my
company
he's
more
than
a
man
and
this
is
more
than
love
the
reason
that
the
sky
is
blue
the
clouds
are
rolling
in
because
i'm
gone
again
and
to
him
i
just
can't
be
true
and
i
know
that
he
knows
i'm
unfaithful
and
it
kills
him
inside
to
know
that
i
am
happy
with
some
other
guy
i
can
see
him
dying
i
don't
wanna
do
this
anymore
i
don't
wanna
be
the
reason
why
every
time
i
walk
out
the
door
i
see
him
die
a
little
more
inside
i
don't
wanna
hurt
him
anymore
i
don't
wanna
take
away
his
life
i
don't
wanna
be
a
murderer
i
feel
it
in
the
air
as
i'm
doing
my
hair
preparing
for
another
date
a
kiss
upon
my
cheek
as
he
reluctantly
asks
if
i'm
gonna
be
out
late
i
say
i
won't
be
long
just
hanging
with
the
girls
a
lie
i
didn't
have
to
tell
because
we
both
know
where
i'm
about
to
go
and
we
know
it
very
well
'cause
i
know
that
he
knows
i'm
unfaithful
and
it
kills
him
inside
to
know
that
i
am
happy
with
some

i
don't
wanna
be
a

our
love
his
trust
i
might
as
well
take
a
gun
and
put
it
to
his
head
get
it
over
with
i
don't
wanna
do
this
anymore
whoa
anymore
and
i
don't
wanna

we'll
do
it
all
everything
on
our
own
we
don't
need
anything
or
anyone
if
i
lay
here
if
i
just
lay
here
would
you
lie
with
me
and
just
forget
the
world
i
don't
quite
know
how
to
say
how
i
feel
those
three
words
are
said
too
much
they're
not
enough
if
i
lay
here
if
i
just
lay
here
would
you
lie
with
me
and
just
forget
the
world
forget
what
we're
told
before
we
get
too
old
show
me
a
garden
that's
bursting
into
life
let's
waste
time
chasing
cars
around
our
heads
i
need
your
grace
to
remind
me
to
find
my
own
if
i
lay
here
if
i
just
lay
here
would
you
lie
with
me
and
just
forget
the
world
forget
what
we're
told
before
we
get
too
old
show
me
a
garden
that's
bursting
into
life
all
that
i
am
all
that
i
ever
was
is
here
in
your
perfect
eyes

all
i
can
see
i
don't
know
where
confused
about
how
as
well
just
know
that
these
things
will
never
change
for
us
at
all
if
i
lay
here
if
i
just
lay
here
would
you
lie
with
me
and
just
forget
the
world

up

should
i
go
back

better

down

along
with

we
know
we
said
someday
we'd

myself
'cause
my
heart
so
much
misery
i
will
not
break
the
way
you
did
you
fell
so
hard
i've
learned
the
hard
way
to
never
let
it
get
that
far
because
of
you
i
never
stray
too
far
from
the
sidewalk
because
of
you
i
learned
to
play
on
the
safe
side
so
i
don't
get
hurt
because
of
you
i
find
it
hard
to
trust
not
only
me
but
everyone
around
me
because
of
you
i
am
afraid
i
lose
my
way
and
it's
not
too
long
before
you
point
it
out
i
cannot
cry
because
i
know
that's
weakness
in
your
eyes
i'm
forced
to
fake
a
smile
a
laugh
every
day
of
my
life
my
heart
can't
possibly
break
when
it
wasn't
even
whole
to
start
with
because
of
you
i
never
stray
too
far
from
the
sidewalk
because
of
you
i
learned

me
but
everyone
around
me
because
of
you
i
am
afraid
i
watched
you
die
i
heard
you
cry
every
night
in
your
sleep
i
watched
you
die
in
your
sleep
i
was
so
young
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
lean
on
me
i
was
too
young
for
you
to
lean
on
me
you
never
thought
of
anyone
else
you
just
saw
your
pain
you
never
saw
me
yeah
yeah
and
now
i
cry
in
the
middle
of
the
night
for
the
same
damn
thing
because
of
you
i
never
stray
too
far
from
the
sidewalk
because
of
you
i
learned
to
play
on
the
safe
side
so
i
don't
get
hurt
because
of
you
i
try
my
hardest
just
to
forget
everything
because
of
you
i
don't
know
how
to
let
anyone
else
in
because
of
you
i'm
ashamed
of
my
life
because
it's
empty
because
of
you
i
am
afraid

of
you

before

didn't
even

the
backseat
sleepin'
like
a
rock
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
she
bowed
her
head
to
pray
she
said

&quot;hi
justin
this
is
your
mother
and
it's
2:33
on
monday
afternoon
i
was
just
calling
to
see
how
you
were
doing
you
sounded
really
uptight
last
night
it
made
me
a
little
nervous
and
a
l...
and...
well...
it
made
me
nervous
it
sounded
like
you
were
nervous
too
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
you
were
really
ok
and
wanted
to
see
if
you
were
checking
in
on
your
medication
you
know
i
love
you
and
take
care
honey
i
know
you're
under
a
lot
of
pressure
see
ya.
bye
bye&quot;
i
have
to
block
out
thoughts
of
you
so
i
don't
lose
my
head
they
crawl
in
like
a
cockroach
leaving
babies
in
my
bed
dropping
little
reels
of
tape
to
remind
me
that
i'm
alone
playing
movies
in
my
head
that
make
a
porno
feel
like
home
there's
a
burning
in
my
pride
a
nervous
bleeding
in
my
brain
an
ounce
of
peace
is
all
i
want
for
you.
will
you
never
call
again
and
will
you
never
say
that
you
loved
me
just
to
put
it
in
my
face
and
will
you
never
try
to
reach
me
it
is
i
that
wanted
space
hate
me
today
hate
me
tomorrow
hate
me
for
all
the
things
i
didn't
do
for
you
hate
me
in
ways
yeah
ways
hard
to
swallow
hate
me
so
you
can
finally
see
what's
good
for
you
i'm
sober
now
for
three
whole
months
it's
one
accomplishment
that
you
helped
me
with
the
one
thing
that
always
tore
us
apart
is
the
one
thing
i
won't
touch
again
in
my
sick
way
i
want
to
thank
you
for
holding
my
head
up
late
at
night
while
i
was
busy
waging
wars
on
myself
you
were
trying
to
stop
the
fight
you
never
doubted
my
warped
opinions
on
things
like
suicidal
hate
you
made
me
compliment
myself
when
it
was
way
too
hard
to
take
so
i'll
drive
so
fucking
far
away
that
i
never
cross
your
mind
and
do
whatever
it
takes
in
your
heart
to
leave
me
behind
hate
me
today
hate
me
tomorrow
hate
me
for
all
the
things
i
didn't
do
for
you
hate
me
in
ways
yeah
ways
hard
to
swallow
hate
me
so
you
can
finally
see
what's
good
for
you
and
with
a
sad
heart
i
say
bye
to
you
and
wave
kicking
shadows
on
the
street
for
every
mistake
that
i
had
made
and
like
a
baby
boy
i
never
was
a
man
until
i
saw
your
blue
eyes
cry
and
i
held
your
face
in
my
hand
and
then
i
fell
down
yelling
&quot;make
it
go
away&quot;
just
make
a
smile
come
back
and
shine
just
like
it
used
to
be
and
then
she
whispered
&quot;how
can
you
do
this
to
me&quot;
hate
me
today
hate
me
tomorrow
hate
me

throwing
things

just
wanna
eat
you
up

it
makes
you
madder
uh
oh
i'm
sorry
but
seeing
you
mad
is
so
sexy
could
it
be
the
little
wrinkle
over
your
nose
when
you
make
your
angry
face
that
makes
me
wanna
just
take
off
all
your
clothes
and
sex
you
all
over
the
place
could
it
be
the
little
way
you
storm
around
that
makes
me
wanna
tear
you
down
baby
i
ain't
sure
but
one
thing
that
i
do
know
is
every
time
you
scream
at
me
i
wanna

baby
don't
think
i
don't
take
you
seriously

i
just
can't
help
the
fact
that
your
attitude
excites
me
so
exciting
and
you
know
ain't
nothing
better
then
when
we
get
mad
together
and
have
angry
sex
i'll
blow
you
out
then
we
forget
what
we
were
mad
about

it
