[gotye:]
now
and
then
i
think
of
when
we
were
together
like
when
you
said
you
felt
so
happy
you
could
die
told
myself
that
you
were
right
for
me
but
felt
so
lonely
in
your
company
but
that
was
love
and
it's
an
ache
i
still
remember
you
can
get
addicted
to
a
certain
kind
of
sadness
like
resignation
to
the
end
always
the
end
so
when
we
found
that
we
could
not
make
sense
well
you
said
that
we
would
still
be
friends
but
i'll
admit
that
i
was
glad
that
it
was
over
but
you
didn't
have
to
cut
me
off
make
out
like
it
never
happened
and
that
we
were
nothing
and
i
don't
even
need
your
love
but
you
treat
me
like
a
stranger
and
that
feels
so
rough
no
you
didn't
have
to
stoop
so
low
have
your
friends
collect
your
records
and
then
change
your
number
i
guess
that
i
don't
need
that
though
now
you're
just
somebody
that
i
used
to
know
now
you're
just
somebody
that
i
used
to
know
now
you're
just
somebody
that
i
used
to
know
[kimbra:]
now
and
then
i
think
of
all
the
times
you
screwed
me
over
but
had
me
believing
it
was
always
something
that
i'd
done
but
i
don't
wanna
live
that
way
reading
into
every
word
you
say
you
said
that
you
could
let
it
go
and
i
wouldn't
catch
you
hung
up
on
somebody
that
you
used
to
know
[gotye:]
but
you
didn't
have
to
cut
me
off
make
out
like

that

were

i
threw
a
wish
in
the
well
don't
ask
me
i'll
never
tell
i
looked
to
you
as

fell
and
now
you're
in
my

my
soul
for
a
wish
pennies
and
dimes
for
a
kiss
i
wasn't
looking
for
this
but
now
you're
in
my
way
your
stare
was
holdin'
ripped
jeans
skin
was
showin'

waiting
for
me
just
across
the
bar
my
seat's
been
taken
by
some
sunglasses
asking
'bout
a
scar
and
i
know
i
gave
it
to
you
months
ago
i
know
you're
trying
to
forget
but
between
the
drinks
and
subtle
things
the
holes
in
my
apologies

i
don't

whatever
on
the
other
side
of
a
street
i
knew
stood
a
girl
that
looked
like
you
i
guess
that's
dxc3xa9jxc3xa0
vu
but
i
thought
this
can't
be
true
'cause
you
moved
to
west
la
or
new
york
or
santa
fe
or
wherever
to
get
away
from
me
oh
but
that
one
night
was
more
than
just
right
i
didn't
leave
you
'cause
i
was
all
through
oh
i
was
overwhelmed
and
frankly
scared
as
hell
because
i
really
fell
for
you
oh
i
swear
to
you
i'll
be
there
for
you
this
is
not
a
drive
by
just
a
shy
guy
looking
for
a
two-ply
hefty
bag
to
hold
my
love
when
you
move
me
everything
is
groovy
they
don't
like
it
sue
me
mmm
the
way
you
do
me

to
you
i'll
be
there
for
you
this
is
not
a
drive
by
on
the
upside
of
a
downward
spiral
my
love
for
you
went
viral
and
i
loved
you
every
mile
you
drove
away
but
now
here
you
are
again
so
let's
skip
the
&quot;how
you
been&quot;
and
get
down
to
the
&quot;more
than
friends&quot;
at
last
oh
but
that
one
night
is
still
the
highlight
i
didn't
need
you
until
i
came
to
and
i
was
overwhelmed
and
frankly
scared
as
hell
because
i
really
fell
for
you
oh
i
swear
to
you
i'll

for
you
this
is
not
a

please
believe
that
when
i
leave
there's
nothing
up
my
sleeve
but
love
for
you
and
a
little
time
to
get
my
head
together

you
can't

we
did
intend
for
us
to

we
didn't

didn't
burn
we
had
to
learn
how
to
bend
without
the
world

in
i
had
to

i
am

to
realize
what
we
used
to
have
we
don't
have

to
this
day
when
i
hear
that
song
i
see
you
standing
there
on
that
lawn
discount
shades
store-bought
tan
flip-flops
and
cut-off
jeans
somewhere
between
that
setting
sun
&quot;i'm
on
fire&quot;
and
&quot;born
to
run&quot;
you
looked
at
me
and
i
was
done
and
we
we're
just
getting
started
i
was
singing
to
you
you
were
singing
to
me
i
was
so
alive
never
been
more
free
fired
up
my
daddy's
lighter
and
we
sang
oh
stayed
there
'til
they
forced
us
out
and
took
the
long
way
to
your
house
i
can
still
hear
the
sound
of
you
saying
&quot;don't
go.&quot;
when
i
think
about
you
i
think
about
17
i
think
about
my
old
jeep
i
think
about
the
stars
in
the
sky
funny
how
a
melody
sounds
like
a
memory
like
a
soundtrack
to
a
july
saturday
night
springsteen
i
bumped
into
you
by
happenstance
you
probably
wouldn't
even
know
who
i
am
but
if
i
whispered
your
name
i
bet
there'd
still
be
a
spark
back
when
i
was
gasoline
and
this
old
tattoo
had
brand
new
ink
and
we
didn't
care
what
your
mom
would
think
'bout
your
name
on
my
arm
baby
is
it
spring
or
is
it
summer
the
guitar
sound
or
the
beat
of
that
drummer
you
hear
sometimes
late
at
night
on
your
radio
even
though
you're
a
million
miles
away
when
you
hear
born
in
the
usa
you

hope
hope
there's
a
conversation
we
both
admit
we
had
it
good
but
until
then
it's
alienation
i
know
that
much
is
understood
and
i
realize
if
you
ask
me
how
i'm
doing
i
would
say
i'm
doing
just
fine
i
would
lie
and
say
that
you're
not
on
my
mind
you're
not
on
my
mind
you're
not
on
my
mind
but
i
go
out
and
i
sit
down
at
a
table
set
for
two
and
finally
i'm
forced
to
face
the
truth
no
matter
what
i
say
i'm
not
over
you
not
over
you
not
over
you
damn
damn
girl
you
do
it
well
and
i
thought
you
were
innocent
took
this
heart
and
put
it
through
hell
but
still
you're
magnificent
i
i'm
a
boomerang
doesn't
matter
how
you
throw
me
i
turn
around
and
i'm
back
in
the
game
even
better
than
the
old
me
old
me
but
i'm
not
even
close
without
you
if
you
ask
me
how
i'm
doing
i
would
say
i'm
doing
just
fine
i
would

that
you're

you
and
if
i
had
the
chance
to
renew
you
know
there
isn't
a
thing
i
wouldn't
do
i
could
get
back
on
the
right
track
but
only
if
you'd
be
convinced
so
until
then
if
you
ask
me
how
i'm
doing
i
would
say
i'm

at
this

i
made
what
your
nigga

she
expected
the

it
flew
away
from

she
ran
away
in
her
sleep

para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise

bunch
of
square
cornfields

wheat
farms

of

man
who

that
earth

seed
busted
his
ass
for
you

me
or

a
harvest
moon
in
kansas

those
fly
over
states
i

mile
long
santa
fe
freight
train
engineer's

all
just
like
that
flatbed
cowboy
stacking
us
steel
on
a
three
day
haul
roads
and
rails
under
their
feet
yeah
that
sounds
like
a
first
class
seat
on
the
plains
of
oklahoma
with
a
windshield
sunset
in
your
eyes
like
a
water
colored
painted
sky
you'll
think
heaven's
doors
have
opened
you'll
understand
why
god
made
those
fly
over
states
take
a
ride
across
the
badlands
feel
that
freedom
on
your
face
breathe
in
all
that
open
space
meet
a
girl
from
amarillo
you'll
understand
why
god
made
you
might
even
wanna
plant
your
stakes
in
those
fly
over
states
have
you
ever
been
through
indiana
on
the
plains
of
oklahoma
take
a
ride
way
back
on
the
radio
dial
the
fire
got
lit
inside
a
bright-eyed
child.
every
note
just
wrapped
around
his
soul
from
steel
guitars
to
memphis
all
the
way
to
rock
and
roll.

enough
to

on
the
sidewalk

to
the
music
playin'
every
friday
night.

i
can
hear
'em

you
were.
