out
she's
saying
&quot;come
get
me&quot;
come
get

i
got
up
and
followed
her
to
the
floor
she
said

baby
this
by
far
is
the
hardest
thing
i
think
i've
ever
had
to
do
to
tell
you
the
woman
i
love
that
i'm
havin'
a
baby
by
a
woman
that
i
barely
even
know
i
hope
you
can
accept
the
fact
that
i'm
man
enough
to
tell
you
this
and
hopefully
you'll
give
me
another
chance
this
ain't
about
my
career
this
ain't
about
my
life
it's
about
us
please
these
are
my
confessions
just
when
i
thought
i
said
all
i
could
say
my
chick
on
the
side
said
she
got
one
on
the
way
these
are
my
confessions
man
i'm
throwed
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do
i
guess
i
gotta
give
you
part
two
of
my
confessions
if
i'm
gonna
tell
it
then
i
gotta
tell
it
all
all
damn
near
cried
when
i
got
that
phone
call
i'm
so
throwed
i
don't
know
what
to
do
but
to
give
you
part
two
of
my
confessions

still
lingers
here

it
won't
leave
me
alone
these
wounds
won't
seem
to
heal
this
pain
is
just
too
real
there's
just

much
that
time
cannot
erase
when
you
cried
i'd
wipe
away
all
of
your
tears
when
you'd
scream
i'd
fight
away
all
of
your
fears
and
i
held
your
hand
through
all
of
these
years
but
you
still
have
all
of
me
you
used
to
captivate
me
by
your
resonating
light
now
i'm
bound
by
the
life
you
left
behind
your
face
it
haunts
my
once
pleasant
dreams
your
voice
it
chased
away
all
the
sanity
in
me
these
wounds
won't
seem
to
heal
this

you
still
have
all
of
me
i've
tried
so
hard
to
tell
myself
that
you're
gone
but
though
you're
still
with
me
i've
been
alone
all
along
when
you
cried
i'd
wipe
away
all
of
your
tears
when
you'd
scream
i'd

if
i
didn't

i'd
still

caused
nothing

when
it's
late
at
night
i
hold
on
to
my
pillow
tight
and
think
of
how
you
promised
me
forever
i
never
thought
that
anyone
could
make
me
feel
this
way
now
that
you're
here
boy
all
i
want
is
just
a
chance
to
say
get
out
leave
right
now
it's
the
end
of
you
and
me
it's
too
late
now
and
i
can't
wait
for
you
to
be
gone
'cause
i
know
about
her
who
and
i
wonder
why
how
i
bought
all
the
lies
you
said
that
you
would
treat
me
right
but
you
was
just
a
waste
of
time
waste
of
time
tell
me
why
you're
looking
so
confused
when
i'm
the
one
who
didn't
know
the
truth
how
could
you
ever
be
so
cold
to
go
behind
my
back
and
call
my
friend
boy
you
must
have
gone
and
bumped
your
head
because
you
left
her
number
on
your
phone
so
now
after
all
is
said
and
done
maybe
i'm
the
one
to
blame
but
to
think
that
you
could
be
the
one
well
it
didn't
work
out
that
way
get
out

i
think
everybody's
got
a
fucking
problem
with
me
dude
and
they
need
to
take
it
up
with
me
after
the
show
because
these
chicks
don't
even
know
the
name
of
my
band
but
they're
all
on
me
like
they
wanna
hold
hands
'cause
once
i
blow
they
know
that
i'll
be
the
man
all
because
i'm
the
lead
singer
of
my
band
so
i
get
off
stage
right
drop
the
mic
walk
up
to
these
hot
chicks
and
i'm
all
like:
&quot;sup
ladies
my
name's
slim
shady
i'm
the
lead
singer
of

baby&quot;
they're
all
like
&quot;oh
my
god

now
by
now
the
rest

and
do
my
a
capellas
all
the

start
yelling
all
the
hot
babes
throw
their
bras
and
their
shirts
and
their
panties
on
stage
so
like
every
single
night
they
pick
a
fight
with
me
but
when
we
fight
it's
kinda
like
sibling
rivalry
'cause
they're
back
on
stage
the
next
night
with
me

when
remember
when
the
sound
of
little
feet
was
the
music
we
danced
to
week
to
week
brought
back
the
love
we
found
trust
vowed
we'd
never
give
it
up
remember
when
remember
when
thirty
seemed
so
old
now
lookin'
back
it's
just
a
steppin'
stone
to
where
we
are
where
we've
been
said
we'd
do
it
all
again
remember
when
remember
when
we
said
when
we
turned
gray
when
the
children
grow
up
and
move
away
we
won't
be
sad
we'll
be
glad
for
all
the
life
we've
had
and
we'll
remember
when
remember
when
remember
when
notice
me
take
my
hand
why
are
we
strangers
when
our
love
is
strong
why
carry
on
without
me
every
time
i
try
to
fly
i
fall
without
my
wings
i
feel
so
small
i
guess
i
need
you
baby
and
every
time
i
see
you
in
my
dreams
i
see
your
face
it's
haunting
me
i
guess
i
need
you
baby
i
make
believe
that
you
are
here
it's
the
only
way
i
see
clear
what
have
i
done
you
seem
to
move
uneasy
and
every
time
i
try
to
fly
i
fall
without
my
wings
i
feel
so
small
i
guess
i
need
you
baby
and
every
time
i
see
you
in
my
dreams
i
see
your
face
you're
haunting
me
i
guess
i
need
you
baby
i
may
have
made
it
rain
please
forgive
me
my
weakness
caused
you
pain
and
this
song's
my
sorry
at
night
i
pray
that
soon
your
face
will
fade
away
and
every
time
i
try
to
fly
i
fall
without
my
wings
i
feel
so
small
i
guess
i
need
you
baby
and
every
time
i

spoil
her
it
gets
annoying
from

know
we'll
be
friends

nothing
more
she
loves
it
when

me
what
to
say
you're
better
off
that
way
don't
think
that
your
charm
and
the
fact
that
your
arm
is
now
around
my
neck
will
get
you
in
my
pants

your
ass
and
make
you
never

i'm
gonna
ask
you
to
stop

you
that
i'm
not
like
that
girl:

it
up
to
you
this
time
did
you

guilt

mess
me
up
i've
done
no
wrong
any
thoughts
of
you
and

that
i
was
gonna
give
it
up
to
you
this
time
did
you

better
off
that
way
better
off
that
way
i'm
better
off
alone
anyway
i
woke
up
early
this
morning
around
4am
with
the
moon
shining
bright
as
headlights
on
the
interstate
i
pulled
the
covers
over
my
head
and
tried
to
catch
some
sleep
but
thoughts
of
us
kept
keeping
me
awake
ever
since
you
found
yourself
in
someone
else's
arms
i've
been
tryin'
my
best
to
get
along
but
that's
ok
there's
nothing
left
to
say
but
take
your
records
take
your
freedom
take
your
memories
i
don't
need'em
take
your
space
and
take
your
reasons
but
you'll
think
of
me
and
take
your
cat
and
leave
my
sweater
'cause
we
have
nothing
left
to
weather
in
fact
i'll
feel
a
whole
lot
better
but
you'll
think
of
me
you'll
think
of
me
i
went
out
driving
trying
to
clear
my
head
i
tried
to
sweep
out
all
the
ruins
that
my
emotions
left
i
guess
i'm
feeling
just
a
little
tired
of
this
and
all
the
baggage
that
seems
to
still
exist
it
seems
the
only
blessing
i
have
left
to
my
name
is
not
knowing
what
we
could
have
been
what
we
should
have
been
so
take
your
records
take
your
freedom
take
your
memories
i
don't
need'em
take
your
space
and
take
your
reasons
but
you'll
think
of
me
and
take
your
cat
and
leave
my
sweater
'cause
we
have
nothing
left
to
weather
in
fact
i'll
feel
a
whole
lot
better
but
you'll
think
of
me
someday
i'm
gonna
run
across
your
mind
don't
worry
i'll
be
fine
i'm
gonna
be
alright
while
you're
sleeping
with
your
pride
wishing
i
could
hold
you
tight
i'll
be
over
you
and
on
with
my
life
so
take
your
records
take
your
freedom
take
your
memories
i
don't
need'em
and
take
your
