i
found
a
love
for
me
oh
darling
just
dive
right
in
and
follow
my
lead
well
i
found
a
girl
beautiful
and
sweet
oh
i
never
knew
you
were
the
someone
waiting
for
me


'cause
we
were
just
kids
when
we
fell
in
love
not
knowing
what
it
was
i
will
not
give
you
up
this
time
but
darling
just
kiss
me
slow
your
heart
is
all
i
own
and
in
your
eyes
you're
holding
mine

baby
i'm
dancing
in
the
dark
with
you
between
my
arms
barefoot
on
the
grass
listening
to
our
favourite
song
when
you
said
you
looked
a
mess
i
whispered
underneath
my
breath
but
you
heard
it
darling
you
look
perfect
tonight


well
i
found
a
woman
stronger
than
anyone
i
know
she
shares
my
dreams
i
hope
that
someday
i'll
share
her
home
i
found
a
love
to
carry
more
than
just
my
secrets
to
carry
love
to
carry
children
of
our
own


we
are
still
kids
but
we're
so
in
love
fighting
against
all
odds
i
know
we'll
be
alright
this
time
darling
just
hold
my
hand
be
my
girl
i'll
be
your
man
i
see
my
future
in
your
eyes


baby
i'm
dancing
in
the
dark
with
you
between
my
arms
barefoot
on
the
grass
listening
to
our
favourite
song
when
i
saw
you
in
that
dress
looking
so
beautiful
i
don't
deserve
this
darling
you
look
perfect
tonight

i'm

you

listening
to
our
favourite
song
i
have
faith
in
what
i
see
now
i
know
i
have

when
i
was
six
years
old
i
broke
my
leg
i
was
running
from
my
brother
and
his
friends
and
tasted
the
sweet
perfume
of
the
mountain
grass
i
rolled
down
i
was
younger
then
take
me
back
to
when
i


found
my
heart
and
broke
it
here
made
friends
and
lost
them
through
the
years
and
i've
not
seen
the
roaring
fields
in
so
long
i
know
i've
grown
but
i
can't
wait
to
go
home

i'm
on
my
way
driving
at
90
down
those
country
lanes
singing
to
"tiny

and
i
miss
the
way
you
make
me
feel
and
it's
real
we
watched
the
sunset
over
the
castle
on
the
hill


fifteen
years
old
and
smoking
hand-rolled
cigarettes
running
from
the
law
through
the
backfields
and
getting
drunk
with
my
friends
had
my
first
kiss
on
a
friday
night
i
don't
reckon
that
i
did
it
right
but
i
was
younger
then
take
me
back
to
when


we
found
weekend
jobs
when
we
got
paid
we'd
buy
cheap
spirits
and
drink
them
straight
me
and
my
friends
have
not
thrown
up
in
so
long
oh
how
we've
grown
but
i
can't
wait
to
go
home

thinking
'bout
how
people
fall
in
love
in
mysterious
ways

just
the
touch
of
a
hand
well
me
i
fall
in
love
with
you
every
single
day
and
i
just
wanna
tell
you
i
am

honey
now
take
me
into
your
loving

under
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
place
your
head
on
my
beating
heart
i'm
thinking
out
loud
and
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are


when
my
hair's
all
but
gone
and
my
memory
fades
and
the
crowds
don't
remember
my
name
when
my
hands
don't
play
the
strings
the
same
way
i
know
you
will
still
love
me
the
same


'cause
honey
your
soul
could
never
grow
old
it's
evergreen
and
baby
your
smile's
forever
in
my
mind
and
memory
i'm
thinking
'bout
how
people
fall
in
love
in
mysterious
ways
and
maybe
it's
all
part
of
a
plan
well
i'll
just
keep
on
making
the
same
mistakes
hoping
that
you'll
understand


that
baby
now
take
me
into
your
loving
arms
kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand

take
me

lyrics
i
met
this
girl
late
last
year
she
said
"don't
you
worry
if
i
disappear"
i
told
her
i'm
not
really
looking
for
another
mistake
i
called
an
old
friend
thinking
that
the
trouble
would
wait
but
then
i
jumped
right
in
a
week
later
returned
i
reckon
she
was
only
looking
for
a
lover
to
burn
but
i
gave
her
my
time
for
two
or
three
nights
then
i
put
it
on
pause
until
the
moment
was
right
i
went
away
for
months
until
our
paths
crossed
again
she
told
me
"i
was
never
looking
for
a
friend
maybe
you
could
swing
by
my
room
around
ten
baby
bring
the
lemon
and
a
bottle
of
gin
we'll
be
in
between
the
sheets
till
the
late
am"
baby
if
you
wanted
me
then
you
should
have
just
said
she's
singing

don't

with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all
over
my
home
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
don't

with
my
love
i
told
her
she
knows
take
aim
and
reload
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe


and
for
a
couple
weeks
i
only
wanna
see
her
we
drink
away
the
days
with
a
takeaway
pizza
before
a
text
message
was
the
only
way
to
reach
her
now
she's
staying
at
my
place
and
loves
the
way
i
treat
her
singing
out
aretha
all
over
the
track
like
a
feature
and
never
wants
to
sleep
i
guess
that
i
don't
want
to
either
but
me
and
her
we
make
money
the
same
way
four
cities
two
planes
the
same
day
and
those
shows
have
never
been
what
it's
about
but
maybe
we'll
go
together
and
just
figure
it
out
i'd
rather
put
on
a
film
with
you
and
sit
on
a
couch
but
we
should
get
on
a
plane
or
we'll
be
missing
it
now
wish
i'd
have
written
it
down
the
way
that
things
played
out
when
she
was
kissing
him
how
i
was
confused
about
now
she
should
figure
it
out
while
i'm
sat
here
singing
you
might
also
like
don't

with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all
over
my
home
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
don't

with
my
love
i
told
her
she
knows
take
aim
and
reload
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe



on
my
hotel
door
i
don't
even
know
if
she
knows
what
for
she
was
crying
on
my
shoulder
i
already
told
ya
trust
and
respect
is
what
we
do
this
for
i
never
intended
to
be
next

but
you
didn't
need
to
take
him
to
bed
that's
all
and
i
never
saw
him
as
a
threat

until
you
disappeared
with
him
to
have
sex
of
course
it's
not
like
we
were
both
on
tour
we
were
staying
on
the
same

hotel
floor
and
i
wasn't
looking
for
a
promise
or
commitment
but
it
was
never
just
fun
and
i
thought
you
were
different
this
is
not
the
way
you
realized
what
you
wanted
it's
a
bit
too
much
too
late
if
i'm
honest
and
all
this
time
god
knows
i'm
singing

don't

lyrics
i
was
born
inside
a
small
town
i
lost
that
state
of
mind
learned
to
sing
inside
the
lord's
house
but
stopped
the
age
of
nine
i
forget
when
i
get
awards
now
the
wave
i
had
to
ride
the
paving
stones
i
played
upon
that
kept
me
on
the
grind
so
blame
it
on
the
pain
that
blessed
me
with
the
life
friends
and
family
filled
with
envy
when
they
should
be
filled
with
pride
and
when
the
world's
against
me
is
when
i
really
come
alive
and
every
day
that
satan
tempts
me
i
try
to
take
it
in
my
stride
you
know
that
i've
got
whisky
with
white
lies
and
smoke
in
my
lungs
i
think
life
has
got
to
the
point
i
know
without
it's
no
fun
i
need
to
get
in
the
right
mind
and
clear
myself
up
instead
i
look
in
the
mirror
questioning
what
i've
become
guess
it's
a
stereotypical
day
for
someone
like
me
without
a
nine-to-five
job
or
a
uni
degree
to
be
caught
up
in
the
trappings
of
the
industry
show
me
the
locked
doors
i'll
find
another
use
for
the
key
and
you'll
see

i'm
well
aware
of
certain
things
that
can
destroy
a
man
like
me
but
with
that
said
give
me
one
more


another
one
to
take
the
sting
away
i
am
happy
on
my
own
so
here
i'll
stay
save
your
lovin'
arms
for
a
rainy
day
and
i'll
find
comfort
in
my
pain
eraser


i
used
to
think
that
nothing
could
be
better
than
touring
the
world
with
my
songs
i
chased
the
pictured
perfect
life
i
think
they
painted
it
wrong
i
think
that
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
and
fame
is
hell
relationships
and
hearts
you
fixed
they
break
as
well
and
ain't
nobody
wanna
see
you
down
in
the
dumps
because
you're
living
your
dream
man
this
shit
should
be
fun

rents
a
house
in

wears
a

drinks

i'm

change

need
time

replace

resist

still
want

is
shattering

strawberries
&
cigarettes
lyrics
remember
when
we
first
met
you
said
"light
my
cigarette"
so
i
lied
to
my
mum
and
dad
i
jumped
the
fence
and
i
ran
but
we
couldn't
go
very
far
'cause
you
locked
your
keys
in
your
car
so
you
sat
and
stared
at
my
lips
and
i
could
already
feel
your
kiss


long
nights
daydreams
sugar
and
smoke
rings
i've
been
a
fool
but
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
you
headlights
on
me
racing
to
60
i've
been
a
fool
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
blue
eyes
black
jeans
lighters
and
candy
i've
been
a
fool
but
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
you


remember
when
you
taught
me
fate
said
it'd
all
be
worth
the
wait
like
that
night
in
the
back
of
the
cab
when
your
fingers
walked
in
my
hand
next
day
nothin'
on
my
phone
but
i
can
still
smell
you
on
my
clothes
always
hoping
that
things
would
change
but
we
went
right
back
to
your
games
you
might
also
like
long
nights
daydreams
sugar
and
smoke
rings
i've
been
a
fool
but
strawberries
and

and
even
if
i
run
away
give
my
heart
a
holiday
still
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
you
you
always
leave
me
wanting
more
i
can't
shake
my
hunger
for
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
you
yeah
they
always
taste

i'm
down
to
my
skin
and
bone
and
my
mummy
she
can't
put
down
the
phone
and
stop
asking
how
i'm
doing
all
alone
alone
but
the
truth
is
the
stars
are
falling
ma
and
the
wolves
are
out
c-calling
ma
and
my
home
has
never
felt
this
far


but
all
this
driving
is
driving
me
crazy
and
all
this
moving
is
proving
to
get
the
best
of
me
and
i've
been
trying
to
hide
it

lately
every

i

i'm

i
can't

i'm
all
alone
all

the

the

never

a
thousand

before
i've
fallen
in
and
out
of
love
i
couldn't
walk

run
at
night
the

i
gave
my

not

the

i'll

i've
been

lyrics
every
little
part
of
me
is
holding
on
to
every
little
piece
of
you
is
holding
on
to
every
drop
of
blood
you
drew
is
holding
onto
you
and
every
waking
hour
i
spend
holding
out
for
reasons
not
to
go
to
bed
i'm
holding
out
for
someone
else
to
hold
instead
if
every
hope
of
you
is
dead


'cause
every
night
since
you
cut
and
run
i
feel
like
the
only
one
who's
ever
been
the
lonely
one
trying
to
mend
a
heart
that
keeps
breaking
with
every
step
that
you're
taking


'cause
you've
been
running
circles
'round
my
mind
turning
me
inside
out
and
i
fell
for
you

hit
the
ground
'cause
the
only
love
i've
known
has
let
me
down

lifting
up
now
you
ain't

i'm

rough

i'm
praying
i
can
pray
enough
so
waking
up
without
you
ain’t
so
tough


find
it
hard
to
find
my
feet
when
i
keep
on
stumbling
over
you
and
me
but
i
keep
on
trying
'cause
i
know
i
need
to
outrun
the
memories
you
might
also
like
and
every
day
i'm
reminded
of
the
way
i
let
it
come
undone
i
feel
like
the
lonely
one
the
only
one
with
time
worth
wasting
well
i
still
can't
stop
chasing

you've

my
mother
said
i'm
too
romantic
she
said
"you're
dancing
in
the
movies"
i
almost
started
to
believe
her
then
i
saw
you
and
i
knew
maybe
it's
'cause
i
got
a
little
bit
older
maybe
it's
all
that
i've
been
through
i'd
like
to
think
it's
how
you
lean
on
my
shoulder
and
how
i
see
myself
with
you


i
don't
say
a
word
but
still
you
take
my
breath
and
steal
the
things
i
know
there
you
go
saving
me
from
out
of
the
cold


fire
on
fire
would
normally
kill
us

this
much
desire
together
we're
winners
they
say
that
we're
out

some
say
we're
sinners
but
don't
let
them
ruin
our
beautiful

when
you
unfold
me

tell
me
you
love
me

you

might

like
when
we
fight
we
fight
like
lions
but
then
we
love
and
feel
the
truth
we
lose
our
minds
in
a
city
of
roses
we
won't

as
time
passes
i
feel
so
low
searchin'
for
pieces
covering
up
the
hole
i'll
fight
for
your
love
i'll
fight
for
your
soul
i'll
throw
all
of
my
cares
away
for
you
i'll
be
there
to
wait
for
you
maybe
you
weren't
the
one
for
me
but
deep
down
i
wanted
you
to
be
i'll
still
see
you
in
my
dreams
all
the
things
that
i
did
for
you
just
wasn't
it
for
you


so
i'll
be
coasting
roller-coasting
through
my
emotion
i
will
be
coasting
roller-coasting
i'm
hoping
that
you'll
come
back
to
me


moving
on
seems
harder
to
do
when
the
one
that
you
love
moves
faster
than
you
i
gave
you
my
all
i
showed
the
proof
of
your
lies
and
you
weren't
worth
it
you
don't
deserve
me
as
time
passes
i'm
feeling
high
you're
not
the
one
i'm
thinking
of
tonight
i
may
not
be
over
you
but
i'll
try
inside
i'm
feeling
better
now
finally
feeling
special
now
oh
you
might
also
like
coasting
roller-coasting
in
my
emotions
oh
i'll
be
coasting
roller-coasting
i
noticed
you
weren't
the
one
for
me


you
weren't
the
one
for
me
you
weren't
the
one
for
me
you
weren't
the
one
for
me
you
weren't
the
one
for
me
weren't
the
one
for
me
you
weren't
the
one
you
weren't
the
one
for
me
so
don't
come
back
to
me
no
no
don't
come
back
to
me
no
no
don't
come
back

never

and
you
push
me

me
from

forever
from

i
would
ride
for
you

you
got
me
shot

got
my

won't
you

our

put
you
first

that
work
i

i

suddenly
the

doesn't
feel
so

made
a

didn't
keep
it


there's
no
windows
in
this

no
answers
to
the
questions
why
nowhere
to
be
found
be
found
now
through
the
fog
so
i'm
trapped
in
this
lighthouse

my
heart
is
gettin'
cold
as
i
count
the
days
i
would
give
my
soul
for
the
chance
to
see
her

all
i
see
are
these
painted

goin'
crazy

to
save
me
from
drownin'

fucking
break
'cause
i
just
railed
down
enough
lines
tonight
to
spell
your
first
and
last
name
i
miss
the
ocean
and
i
know
it's
weird
to
say
i
grew
up
there
moved
to
la
it's
only
thirty
minutes
405
to
pch
but
half
an
hour
feels
forever
and
a
fucking
day


and
it's
all
because
i
dreamt
of
you
and
woke
up
alone
what
a
wonderful
tone
to
bring
you
back
home


my
soul
is
burning
need
jesus
christ
my
mom’s
unhappy
with
all
the
choices
i’ve
been
making
with
my
life
i
don't
even
fucking
care
though
i'm
probably
gonna
die
like
everybody
else
is
that
such
a
fucking
lie
and
i
swear
to
god
if
the
alcohol
and
drugs
don't
kill
me
i
don't
know
what
will
other
than
you
you
might
also
like
and
it's
all
because
i
dreamt
of
you
and
woke
up
alone
and
when
friends
hit
my
phone
all
they
want's
a
repost
it's
all
because
i
dreamt
of
you
and
woke
up
alone
what
a
wonderful

up
in

at
my

now

i
burned
three
chanel

three
words
we
don't
say
now

and
it's
hard
not
to
drink
when
it's
the
one
thing
i
think
about
it's
a
lot
of
spiders
in
the
attic
i
don't
mean
to
be
dramatic
but
i
think
it's
kinda
tragic
who
we
magically
became

you
should

moment’s
silence

lyrics
when
stunted
hand
earns
place
with
man
by
mere
monstrosity
alarms
are
struck
and
shore
is
shook
by
sheer
atrocity
a
cure
i
know
that
soothes
the
soul
does
so
impossibly
a
moment's
silence
when
my
baby
puts
the
mouth
on
me
and
my
babe
relax
and
catch
the
manic
rhapsody
all
reason
flown
as
god
looks
on
in
abject
apathy
a
squall
and
all
of
me
is
a
prayer
in
perfect
piety
a
moment's
silence
when
my
baby
puts
the
mouth
on
me


when
the
meaning
is
gone
there
is
clarity
and
the
reason
comes
on
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me

and
it's
easy
done
our
little
remedy
and
the
reason
comes
on
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me


what
yields
the
need
for
those
who
lead
us
oh
so
morally
those
that
would
view
the
same
we
do
through
their
deformity
who
view
the
deed
as
power's
creed
as
pure
authority
this
moment's
silence
when
my
baby
puts
the
mouth
on
me
you
might
also
like
since
it
all
begun
to
it's
reckoning
there
the
reason
comes
on
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me
be
thankful
some
know
it
lovingly
there
the
reason
comes
in
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me


like
a
heathen
clung
to
the
homily
let
the
reason
come
on
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me
so
summon
on
the
pearl
rosary

watch
the
work
of
my
kin
bold

boyful
toying
somewhere
between
love
and
abuse
calling

join
them
the

joyful
shaking
the

their
terrible
youths
freshly
disowned
in
some
frozen
devotion
no
more
alone

myself

i
be
lurched
like
a
stray
to
the
arms
that
were
open
no
shortage

sordid
no
protest

me

sweetened

down

rest

feet
fresh

you're

without

when

when
i
was

i
heard
voices
some
would
sing
and
some
would
scream
you
soon
find
you
have
few
choices
i
learned
the
voices
died
with
me
when
i
was

i'd
sit
for
hours
staring

something
in
it
had
a
power
could
barely
tear
my
eyes
away

you
have
is
your
fire

the
place
you
need
to
reach
don't
you
ever
tame
your
demons

always
keep
them
on
a
leash

i
was
sixteen
my

fooled
me
thought
gasoline
was

i
knew
that

don't
you

demons
always
keep
them

when
i
was
a
man
i
thought
it
ended
when
i
knew
love's
perfect
ache
but
my
peace
has
always
depended

all
the

peace

the
damp

yields
to
me
i
have
never

these

morning
reveals
to
me
you
might
also
like

you
haven't
moved
an
inch
such
that
i
would
not
know

you
sleep
always

this
the
flesh
calmly
going
cold


we'll
lay
here

years

your

my

still

we'd

this
club
here
is
stuck
up
dinner
and
diatribes
i
knew
well
from
our
first
hookup
the
look
of
mischief
in
your
eyes
your
friends
are
a
fate
that
befell
me
hell
is
the
talking
type
i'd
suffer
hell
if
you’d
tell
me
what
you'd
do
to
me
tonight


tell
me
tell
me
tell
me
ah


that's
the
kind
of
love
i’ve
been
dreaming
of
that's
the
kind
of
love
i've
been
dreaming
of


honey
i
laugh
when
it
sinks
in
a
pillar
i
am
upright
scarcely
can
speak
for
my
thinking
what
you'd
do
to
me
tonight
now
that
the
evening
is
slowing
now
that
the
end's
in
sight
honey
it's
easier
knowing
what
you'd
do
to
me
tonight
you
might
also
like
tell
me
tell
me
tell
your
man


that's
the
kind
of
love
i’ve
been
dreaming
of
that’s
the
kind
of
love
i've
been
dreaming
of



oh
let
there
be
hotel
complaints
and
grievances
raised
and
that
kind
of
love

oh
let
there
be
damage
ensued
and
tabloid
news
and
that
kind
of
love

that's
the
kind
of
love
i've
been
dreaming

ah
oh-oh-oh

got
out
yeah
we
finally
knocked
down


'cause
sometimes
it's
better
that
way
gotta
let
it
go
so
your
heart
don't
break
'cause
i
love
you
yeah
baby
i

you
just
this
one

hear
what
i'm
tryna
say
know
you
might
not
feel
quite
the

i

you
i
tell
you
i

you


why
why
wait

fight
give
it
a

your

i'm
making
you
cry
why
wait
to
hate
can
we
save
love


i
fell
in
i'm
falling
i'm
for
you
i
can't
let
you
fall
through
the
floor
too
it's
a
gamble
to
take
any
more
of
you

still
in
my
mind
sometimes
i
must
admit
it
like
it's
a
crime
on
trial
i
got
acquitted
me
and
you
wasn't
meant
we
wasn't
fitted
like
it's
a
glove
i
hated
to
admit
it
you
might
also
like
'cause
obviously
we
go
back
so
why
would
we
ruin
that
in
too
deep
we're
rearranged
now
you
wanna
ask
for
names

fruit
go

sayin'

you

it

caught
between
a
dream

in
a
way
you
know
what
i
mean
when
the
dark
turns
to
mist
i
just
can't
resist
it


'cause
i'm
a
fool
for
you
and
the

you
do

just
can't
resist
it
i
know
sometimes
i
hide
it
but
i
can't
this
time
'cause
it's
gonna
defeat
me
but
you
won't
believe

the
chance
i'd
do
it
again
'cause
i
can't

myself
'cause

myself

i
think
we
met
and
the
time
flies
i
took
your
digits
a
while
back
i
think
we
fucked
in
the
flashback
won't
leave
my
mind
kinda
sidetracked
felt
good
but
now
i
feel
bad
i
think
i
know
i
can't
take
it
back
no
there's
nothin'
i
can
say


must
be
an
addiction
i
wanted
it
all
didn't
expect
it
to
fall
must
be
an
affliction
i
wanted
to
call
but
i
didn't
call
now
it's
keepin'
me
up
night
and
day
keepin'
me
up
night
and
day
must
be
an
addiction
now
there's
nothin'
i
can
say

i
guess
i
want
too
much

i
just
want
love
and
lust

you
just
can't
love
enough

that's
why
i

you
might
also
like
i
never
meant

but
i
did
though
i
gotta
keep
it
on
the
d-low
then
again
what
the
fuck
do
i
know
you're
always
on
my
mind
so
felt
good
but
now
i

when
the
room
becomes
a
game
we
play
white
lines
they
seem
to
turn
to
snakes
i
guess
i'll
turn
you
'way
say
white
lies
to
your
face
you
know
i
know
my

nothin'
