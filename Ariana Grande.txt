if
you
stayed
the
night
i
just
think
i'm
on
another
page
tonight
it
ain't
nothing
wrong
with
saying
i
need
me
time
usually
i
would
orbit
around
you
but
gravity
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
that's
pulling
me
you'll
be
my
rise
and
shine
soon
as
them
stars
align
mmm


baby
i
can't
really
miss
you
if
i'm
with
you
and
when
i
miss
you
it'll
change
the
way
i
kiss
you
baby
you
know
time
apart
is
beneficial
it's
like
i'm
the
universe
and
you
be
n-a-s-a


give
you
the
whole
world
i'ma
need
space
i'ma
need
space
i'ma
i'ma
need
you
know
i'm
a
star;
space
i'ma
need
space
i'ma
need
space
i'ma
i'ma
need
space

give
you
the
whole
world
i'ma

you
don't
wanna
leave
me
but
i'm
tryna
self-discover
keep
me
in
your
orbit
and
you
know
you'll
drag
me
under
you
don't
wanna
leave
me
but
i'm
tryna
self-discover

keep
me
in
your
orbit
and
you
know
you'll
drag
me
under


i'd
rather
be
alone
tonight

you
can
say
"i
love
you"
through
the
phone
tonight
