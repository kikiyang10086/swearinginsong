right
where
we
are
when
my
hair's
all
but

and
my
memory
fades
and
the
crowds
don't
remember
my
name
when
my
hands
don't
play
the
strings
the
same
way
mmm...

will
still

mysterious
ways
maybe
it's
all
part
of
a
plan

on
making
the
same
mistakes

i've
forgotten
how
it
felt
before
the

such
a
difference
between
us
and
a

of
this
city
away
from
the
crowds&quot;
i
thought
&quot;heaven
can't
help
me
now&quot;
nothing
lasts
forever
but
this
is
gonna
take
me
down
he's
so
tall
and
handsome
as
hell
he's
so
bad
but
he
does
it
so
well
i
can
see
the
end
as
it
begins
my
one
condition
is
say
you'll
remember
me
standin'
in
a
nice
dress
starin'
at
the
sunset
babe
red
lips
and
rosy
cheeks
say
you'll
see
me
again
even
if
it's
just
in
your
wildest
dreams

wildest
dreams
ah

i
said
&quot;no
one
has
to
know
what
we
do&quot;
his
hands
are
in
my
hair
his
clothes
are
in
my
room
and
his
voice
is
a
familiar
sound
nothin'
lasts
forever
but
this
is
gettin'
good
now
he's
so
tall
and
handsome
as
hell
he's
so
bad
but
he
does
it
so
well
and
when
we've
had
our
very
last
kiss

last
request

i'm
acting
a
bit
crazy
strung
out
a
little
bit
hazy
hand
over
heart
i'm
praying
that
i'm
gonna
make
it
out
alive
the
bed's
getting
cold
and
you're
not
here

that
we
hold
is

i'm
not
alive
until
you
call
and
i'll
bet
the
odds
against
it
all
save
your
advice
'cause
i
won't
hear
you
might
be
right
but
i
don't
care
there's
a
million
reasons
why
i
should
give
you
up
but
the
heart
wants
what
it
wants
the
heart
wants
what
it
wants
you
got
me
scattered
in
pieces
shining
like
stars
and
screaming
lighting
me
up
like
venus
but
then
you
disappear
and
make
me
wait
and
every
second's
like
torture
heroin
drip
no
more
so
finding
a
way
to
let
go
baby
baby
no
i
can't
escape
the
bed's
getting
cold

you
where

you
come
from
you're
a
different
different
kind
of
fun
and
i'm
so
used
to
feeling
numb
now
i've
got
pins
and
needles
on
my
tongue
anticipating
what's
to
come
like
a
finger
on
a
loaded
gun
i
can
feel
it
rising
temperature
inside
me
haven't
felt
it
for
a
long
time
this
is

i
never
would've
had
a
doubt
if
i'd
have
known
where
i'd
be
now
your
hands
on
my
hips
and
my
kiss
on
your
lips
oh
i
could
do
this
for
a
long
time

can't
believe
i
ever
breathed
without
you
baby
you
make
me
feel
alive

ah
lahmlahlah
ah
lahmlahlah
i
met
this
girl
late
last
year
she
said
&quot;don't
you
worry
if
i
disappear.&quot;
i
told
her
i'm
not
really
looking
for
another
mistake
i
called
an
old
friend
thinking
that
the
trouble
would
wait
but
then
i
jump
right
in
a
week
later
returned
i
reckon
she
was
only
looking
for
a
lover
to
burn
but
i
gave
her
my
time
for
two
or
three
nights
then
i
put
it
on
pause
until
the
moment
was
right
i
went
away
for
months
until
our
paths
crossed
again
she
told
me
&quot;i
was
never
looking
for
a
friend.
maybe
you
could
swing
by
my
room
around
10:00.
baby
bring
a
lemon
and
a
bottle
of
gin.
we'll
be
in
between
the
sheets
'til
the
late
am.
baby
if
you
wanted
me
then
you
should've
just
said.&quot;
she's
singing
ah
lahmlahlah
don't
fuck
with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all
over
my
home
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
ah
lahmlahlah
don't
fuck
with
my
love
i
told
her
she
knows
take
aim
and
reload
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
ah
lahmlahlah
and
for
a
couple
weeks
i
only
wanna
see
her
we
drink
away
the
days
with
a
take-away
pizza
before
a
text
message
was
the
only
way
to
reach
her
now
she's
staying
at
my
place
and
loves
the
way
i
treat
her
singing
out
aretha
all
over
the
track
like
a
feature
and
never
wants
to
sleep
i
guess
that
i
don't
want
to
either
but
me
and
her
we
make
money
the
same
way
four
cities
two
planes
the
same
day
and
those
shows
have
never
been
what
it's
about
but
maybe
we'll
go
together
and
just
figure
it
out
i'd
rather
put
on
a
film
with
you
and
sit
on
a
couch
but
we
should
get
on
a
plane
or
we'll
be
missing
it
now
wish
i'd
have
written
it
down
the
way
that
things
played
out
when
she
was
kissing
him
how
i
was
confused
about
now
she
should
figure
it
out
while
i'm
sat
here
singing
ah
lahmlahlah
don't
fuck
with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all
over
my
home
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
ah
lahmlahlah
don't
fuck
with
my
love
i
told
her
she
knows
take
aim
and
reload
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
ah
lahmlahlah
[knock
knock
knock]
on
my
hotel
door
i
don't
even
know
if
she
knows
what
for
she
was
crying
on
my
shoulder
i
already
told
ya
trust
and
respect
is
what
we
do
this
for
i
never
intended
to
be
next
but
you
didn't
need
to
take
him
to
bed
that's
all
and
i
never
saw
him
as
a
threat
until
you
disappeared
with
him
to
have
sex
of
course
it's
not
like
we
were
both
on
tour
we
were
staying
on
the
same
fucking
hotel
floor
and
i
wasn't
looking
for
a
promise
or
commitment
but
it
was
never
just
fun
and
i
thought
you
were
different
this
is
not
the
way
you
realize
what
you
wanted
it's
a
bit
too
much
too
late
if
i'm
honest
and
all
this
time
god
knows
i'm
singing
ah
lahmlahlah
[2x:]
don't
fuck
with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all

to
the

to
pray
'cause
i
need
something
that
can
wash
out
the
pain
and
at
most
i'm
sleeping
all
these
demons
away
but
your
ghost
the
ghost
of
you
it
keeps
me
awake
my
friends
had
you
figured
out
yeah
they
saw
what's
inside
of
you
you
tried
hiding
another
you
but
your
evil
was
coming
through
these
eyes
sitting
on
the
wall
they
watch
every
move
i
make
bright
light
living
in
the
shade
your
cold
heart
makes
my
spirit
shake
i
had
to
go
through
hell
to
prove
i'm
not
insane
had
to
meet
the
devil
just
to
know
his
name
and
that's
when
my
love
was
burning
yeah
it's
still
burning
[2x:]

that
i
think
you're
gone
i
turn
around
and
you're
creeping
in
and
i
let
you
under
my
skin
guess
i
love
living
in
the
sin
oh
you
never
told
me
true
love
was
gonna
hurt
true

i
can't
wait
till
we
can
break
up
outta
here
excuse
me
if
i
seem
a
little
unimpressed
with
this
an
anti-social
pessimist
but
usually
i
don't
mess
with
this
and
i
know
you
mean
only
the
best
and
your
intentions
aren't
to
bother
me
but
honestly
i'd
rather
be
somewhere
with
my
people
we
can
kick
it
and
just
listen
to
some
music
with
a
message
like
we
usually
do
and
we'll
discuss
our
big
dreams
how
we
plan
to
take
over
the
planet
so
pardon
my
manners
i
hope
you'll
understand
it
that
i'll
be
here
not
there
in
the
kitchen
with
the
girl
who's
always
gossiping
about
her
friends
so
tell
them
i'll
be
here
right
next
to
the
boy
who's
throwing
up
'cause
he
can't
take
what's
in
his
cup
no
more

and
i'm
done
