i'm
tryin'
to
grow
a
mustache
i
eat
cheese
but
only
on
pizza
please
and
sometimes
on
a
homemade
quesadilla
otherwise
it
smells
like
feet
to
me
and
i
i
really
like
it
when
the
moon
looks
like
a
toenail

i
love
it

i'll

it's
easier
to

you
wanna
hear
what
lives
in

i
never

an
adverb
