[will.i.am:]
what's
wrong
with
the
world
mama
people
livin'
like
they
ain't
got
no
mamas
i
think
the
whole

addicted
to
the
drama
only
attracted
to
things
that'll
bring
you
trauma
overseas
yeah
we
tryna
stop
terrorism

we
still

terrorists
here

in
the
usa
the
big
cia
the
bloods
and
the
crips
and
the
kkk
but
if
you
only
have
love
for
your
own
race
then
you
only
leave
space
to
discriminate
and
to
discriminate
only
generates
hate
and
when
you
hate
then
you're
bound
to
get
irate
yeah
madness
is
what
you
demonstrate
and
that's
exactly
how
anger
works
and
operates
man
you
gotta
have
love
just
to
set
it
straight
take
control
of
your
mind
and
meditate
let
your
soul
gravitate
to
the
love
y'all

the
down
on

today
what

nothing
comes
easy
it
takes
much
practice
like
i
met
a
woman
who's
becoming
a
star
she
was
very
beautiful
leaving
people
in
awe
singing
songs
lena
horne
but
the
younger
version
hung
with
the
wrong
person
got
her
strung
on
that
heroin
cocaine
sniffing
up
drugs
all
in
her
nose
could've
died
so
young
now
looks
ugly
and
old
no
fun
'cause
now
when
she
reaches
for
hugs
people
hold
their
breath
'cause
she
smells
of
corrosion
and
death
watch
the
company
you
keep
and
the
crowd
you
bring
'cause
they
came
to
do
drugs
and
you
came
to
sing
so
if
you
gonna
be
the
best
i'ma
tell
you
how
put
your
hands
in
the
air
and
take
the
vow
i
know
i
can
i
know
i

every

came

get
books
to
learn
from
black
teachers
who
taught
greeks
and
romans
asian
arabs
and
gave

gold

gold
was
converted

it
all
changed
money

became
empowerment

europeans
the

this

[chorus]
[christina

so
what
am
i
not
'sposed
to
have
an
opinion
should
i
keep
quiet
just
because
i'm
a
woman
call
me
a
bitch
'cause
i
speak
what's
on
my
mind
guess
it's
easier
for
you
to
swallow
if
i
sat
and
smiled
when
a
female
fires
back
suddenly
big
talker
don't
know
how
to
act
so
he
does
what
any
little
boy
would
do
makin'
up
a
few
false
rumors
or
two
that
for
sure
is
not
a
man
to
me
slanderin'
names
for
popularity
it's
sad
you
only
get
your
fame
through
controversy
it's
so
sad
but
now
it's
time
for
me
to
come
and
give
you
more
to
say
this
is
for
my
girls
all
around
the
world
around
the
world
who've
come
across
a
man
that
don't
respect
your
worth
whoa
thinkin'
all
women
should
be
seen
not
heard
whoa
so
what
do
we
do
girls
shout
louder
lettin'
'em
know
we're
gonna
stand
our
ground
stand
our
ground
lift
your
hands
high
and
wave
'em
proud
whoa
take
a
deep
breath
and
say
it
loud
whoa
never
can
never
will
can't
hold
us
down
nobody
can
hold
us
down
hold
us
down
nobody
can
hold
us
down
hold
us
down
nobody
gonna
hold
us
down
hold
us
down
never
can
never
will
so
what
am
i
not
'sposed
to
say
what
i'm
sayin'
are
you
offended
with
the
message
i'm
bringin'
call
me
whatever
'cause
your
words
don't
mean
a
thing
guess
you
ain't
even
a
man
enough
to
handle
what
i
sing
if
you
look
back
in
history
it's
a
common
double
standard
of
society
the
guy
gets
all
the
glory
the
more
he
can
score
while
the
girl
can
do
the
same
and
yet
you
call
her
a
whore
i
don't
understand
why
it's
okay
the
guy
can
get
away
with
it
the
girl
gets
named
all
my
ladies
come
together
and
make
a
change
and
start
a
new
beginning
for
us
everybody

took
all
i
ever

that
you
were
true
guess
i
i
couldn't
trust
called
your
bluff
time
is
up
'cause
i've
had
enough
you
were
there
by
my
side
always
down
for
the
ride
but
your
joy
ride
just
came
down
in
flames
'cause
your
greed
sold
me
out
in
shame
mhm
after
all
of
the
stealing
and
cheating
you
probably
think
that
i
hold
resentment
for
you
but
uh-uh
oh
no
you're
wrong
'cause
if
it
wasn't
for
all
that
you
tried
to
do
i
wouldn't
know
just
how
capable
i
am
to
pull
through
so
i
wanna
say
thank
you
'cause
it
makes
me
that
much
stronger
makes
me
work
a
little
bit
harder
makes
me
that
much
wiser
so
thanks
for
making
me
a
fighter
made
me
learn
a
little
bit
faster
made
my
skin
a
little
bit
thicker
makes
me
that
much
smarter
so

for
making
me

oh
oh
oh
oh
oh-oh-oh

saw
it
coming

of
your
backstabbing
just
so
you
could
cash
in
on
a
good
thing
before
i
realized
your
game
i
heard
you're
goin'
'round
playin'
the
victim
now
but
don't
even
begin
feeling
i'm
the
one
to
blame
'cause
you
dug
your
own
grave
after
all
of
the
fights
and
the
lies
guess
you're
wanting
to
hold
me
but
that
won't
work
anymore
no
more
a-ha
it's
over
'cause
if
it
wasn't
for
all
of
your
torture
i
wouldn't
know
how
to
be
this
way
now
and
never
back
down
so
i
wanna
say
thank
you

even
did
a
little
time
in
the

she
snuck
out
one
night
and
met
me
by
the

gate
her
daddy
came
out
wavin'
that
twelve
gauge
we
tore
out
the
drive
he
peppered
my

what
was

thinkin'
oh
i
knew
there'd
be
hell
to
pay
but
that
crossed
my

late...

i

'bout

there
in

off
the

was

a

and
had
the

blastin'
hit
the

tonk
for
a
little
close
dancin'
what
was

knew
there'd

of

like

finally
got

at

it
in

my

she
gave
a

everybody's
looking
for
that
something
one
thing
that
makes
it

find
it
in
the

places

you
never
knew

who
can

the
joy
it
brings
when
you
find
that
special
thing
you're
flying
without

some
find
it
sharing
in
every
morning
some
in
their
solitary
lives
you'll
find
it
in
the
works
of
others
a
simple
line
can
make
you
laugh

you'll

so
impossible
as
they
may
seem
you've
got
to
fight
for
every

to
know
which
one
you
let
go
would
have
made
you
complete

but
for
me
it's
waking
up
beside
you
to
watch
the
sun
rise
on
your
face
to
know
that
i
can

these
ideas
are
nightmares
to
white
parents
whose
worst
fear
is
a
child
with
dyed
hair
and
who
likes
earrings
like
whatever
they
say
has
no
bearing
it's
so
scary
in
a
house
that
allows
no
swearing
to
see
him
walkin'
around
with
his
headphones
blarin'
alone
in
his
own
zone
cold
and
he
don't
care
he's
a
problem
child
and
what
bothers
him
all
comes
out
when
he
talks
about
his
fuckin'
dad
walkin'
out
bitch
'cause
he
hates
him
so
bad
that
he
blocks
him
out
if
he
ever
saw
him
again
he'd
probably
knock
him
out
his
thoughts
are
wacked
he's
mad
so
he's
talkin'
back
talkin'
black
brainwashed
from
rock
and
rap
he
sags
his
pants
do-rags
and
a
stockin'
cap
his
step-father
hit
him
so
he
socked
him
back
and
broke
his
nose
his
house
is
a
broken
home
there's
no
control
he
just
lets
his
emotions
go

huh-uh
i
guess
words
are
a
motherfucker
they
can
be
great
or
they
can
degrade
or
even
worse
they
can
teach
hate
it's
like
these
kids
hang
on
every
single
statement
we
make
like
they
worship
us
plus
all
the
stores
ship
us
platinum
now
how
the
fuck
did
this
metamorphosis
happen
from
standin'
on
corners
and
porches
just
rappin'
to
havin'
a
fortune
no
more
kissin'
ass
but
then
these
critics
crucify
you
yep
journalists
try
to
burn
you
fans
turn
on
you
attorneys
all
want
a
turn
at
you
to
get
their
hands
on
every
dime
you
have
they
want
you
to
lose
your
mind
every
time
you
mad
so
they
can
try
to
make
you
out
to
look
like
a
loose
cannon
any
dispute
won't
hesitate
to
produce
handguns
that's
why
these
prosecutors
wanna
convict
me
strictly
just
to
get
me
off
of
these
streets
quickly
but
all
their
kids
be
listenin'
to
me
religiously
so
i'm
signin'
cds
while
police
fingerprint
me
they're
for
the
judge's
daughter
but
his
grudge
is
against
me
if
i'm
such
a
fuckin'
menace
this
shit
doesn't
make
sense
b
it's
all
political
if
my
music
is
literal
and
i'm
a
criminal
how
the
fuck
can
i
raise
a
little
girl
i
couldn't
i
wouldn't
be
fit
to
you're
full
of
shit
too
guerrera
that
was
a

with
me
it's
just
for
today
maybe
tomorrow
the
good
lord
will
take
you
away
they
say
music
can
alter
moods
and
talk
to
you
well
can
it
load
a
gun
up
for
you
and
cock
it
too
well
if
it
can
then
the
next
time
you
assault
a
dude
just
tell
the
judge
it
was
my
fault
and
i'll
get
sued
see
what
these
kids
do
is
hear
about
us
totin'
pistols
and
they
wanna
get
one
'cause
they
think
the
shit's
cool
not
knowin'
we
really
just
protectin'
ourselves
we
entertainers
of
course
the
shit's
affectin'
our
sales
you
ignoramus
but
music
is
reflection
of
self
we
just
explain
it
and
then
we
get
our
checks
in
the
mail
it's
fucked
up
ain't
it
how
we
can
come
from
practically
nothin'
to
bein'
able
to
have
any
fuckin'
thing
that
we
wanted
that's
why
we
sing
for
these
kids
who
don't
have
a
thing
except
for
a
dream
and
a
fuckin'
rap
magazine
ha-ha
who
post
pin-up
pictures
on
their
walls
all
day
long
idolize
their
favorite
rappers
and
know
all
their
songs
or
for
anyone
who's
ever
been
through
shit
in
their
lives
so
they
sit
and
they
cry
at
night
wishin'
they'd
die
'til
they
throw
on
a
rap
record
and
they
sit
and
they
vibe
we're
nothin'
to
you
but
we're
the
fuckin'
shit
in
their
eyes
that's
why
we
seize
the
moment
try
to
freeze
it
and
own
it
squeeze
it
and
hold
it
'cause
we
consider
these
minutes
golden
and
maybe
they'll
admit
it
when
we're
gone
just
let
our
spirits
live
on
through
our
lyrics
that
you
hear
in
our
songs
and
we

hear
people
saying
we
don't
need
this
war
but
i
say
there's
some
things
worth
fighting
for
what
about
our
freedom
and
this
piece
of
ground
we
didn't
get
to
keep
'em
by
backing
down
they
say
we
don't
realize
the
mess
we're
getting
in
before
you
start
your
preaching
let
me
ask
you
this
my
friend
have
you
forgotten
how
it
felt
that
day
to
see
your
homeland
under
fire
and
her
people
blown
away
have
you
forgotten
when
those
towers
fell
we
had
neighbors
still
inside
going
through
a
living
hell
and
you
say
we
shouldn't
worry
'bout
bin
laden
have
you
forgotten
they
took
all
the
footage
off
my
t.v.
said
it's
too
disturbing
for
you
and
me
it'll
just
breed
anger
that's
what
the

to
rest
anywhere
we
want
to
go
in
your
house
i
long
to
be
room
by
room
patiently
i'll
wait
for
you
there
like
a
stone
i'll
wait
for
you
there
alone
and
on
my
deathbed
i
will
pray
to
the
gods
and
the
angels
like
a
pagan
to
anyone
who
will
take
me
to
heaven
to
a
place
i
recall
i
was
there
so
long
ago
the
sky
was
bruised
the
wine
was
bled
and
there
you
led
me
on
in
your
house
i
long
to
be
room
by
room
patiently
i'll
wait
for
you
there
like
a
stone
i'll
wait
for
you
there
alone
alone
and
on
i
read
until
the
day
was
gone
and
i
sat
in
regret
of
all
the
things
i've
done
for
all
that
i've
blessed
and
all
that
i've
wronged
in
dreams
until
my
death
i
will
wander
on
in
your
house
i
long
to
be
room
by
room
patiently
i'll
wait
for
you
there
like
a
stone
i'll
wait
for
you
there
alone
alone
i
waited
'til
i
saw
the
sun
i
don't
know
why
i
didn't
come
i
left
you
by
the
house
of
fun
i
don't
know
why
i
didn't
come
i
don't
know
why
i
didn't
come
when
i
saw
the
break
of
day
i
wished
that
i
could
fly
away
instead
of
kneeling
in
the
sand
catching
teardrops
in
my
hand
my
heart
is
drenched
in
wine
but
you'll
be
on
my
mind
forever
out
across
the
endless
sea
i
would
die
in
ecstasy
but
i'll
be
a
bag
of
bones
driving
down
the
road
alone
my
heart
is
drenched
in
wine
but
you'll
be
on
my
mind
forever
something
has
to
make
you
run
i
don't
know
why
i
didn't
come
i
feel
as
empty
as
a
drum
i
don't
know
why
i
didn't
come
