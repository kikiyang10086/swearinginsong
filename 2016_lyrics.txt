for
all
the
times
that
you
rained
on
my
parade
and
all
the
clubs
you
get
in
using
my
name
you
think
you
broke
my
heart
oh
girl
for
goodness'
sake
you
think
i'm
cryin'
on
my
own.
well
i
ain't
and
i
didn't
wanna
write
a
song
'cause
i
didn't
want
anyone
thinking
i
still
care.
i
don't
but
you
still
hit
my
phone
up
and
baby
i'll
be
movin'
on
and
i
think
you
should
be
somethin'
i
don't
wanna
hold
back
maybe
you
should
know
that
my
mama
don't
like
you
and
she
likes
everyone
and
i
never
like
to
admit
that
i
was
wrong
and
i've
been
so
caught
up
in
my
job
didn't
see
what's
going
on
but
now
i
know
i'm
better
sleeping
on
my
own
'cause
if
you
like
the
way
you
look
that
much
oh
baby
you
should
go
and
love
yourself
and
if
you
think
that
i'm
still
holdin'
on
to
somethin'
you
should
go
and
love
yourself
but
when
you
told
me
that
you
hated
my
friends
the
only
problem
was
with
you
and
not
them
and
every
time
you
told
me
my
opinion
was
wrong
and
tried
to
make
me
forget
where
i
came
from
and
i
didn't
wanna
write
a
song
'cause
i
didn't
want
anyone
thinking
i
still
care.
i
don't

you

we're
stressed

sometimes
a

smell
will
take
me
back

when
i
was
young
how
come
i'm
never
able
to
identify
where
it's
coming
from
i'd
make
a
candle
out
of
it
if
i
ever
found
it
try
to
sell
it
never
sell
out
of
it
i'd
probably
only
sell
one
it'd
be
to
my
brother
'cause
we
have
the
same
nose
same
clothes
homegrown
a
stone's
throw
from
a
creek
we
used
to
roam
but
it
would
remind
us
of
when
nothing
really
mattered
out
of
student
loans
and
tree-house
homes
we
all
would
take
the
latter
my
name's
'blurryface'
and
i
care
what
you
think
my
name's
'blurryface'

i've
forgotten
how
it
felt
before
the
world
fell
at
our
feet
there's
such
a
difference
between
us
and
a
million

once
i
was
seven
years
old
my
mama
told
me
&quot;go
make
yourself
some
friends
or
you'll
be
lonely&quot;
once
i
was
seven
years
old
it
was
a
big
big
world
but
we
thought
we
were
bigger
pushing
each
other
to
the
limits
we
were
learning
quicker
by
eleven
smoking
herb
and
drinking
burning
liquor
never
rich
so
we
were
out
to
make
that
steady
figure
once
i
was
eleven
years
old
my
daddy
told
me
&quot;go
get
yourself
a
wife
or
you'll
be
lonely&quot;
once
i
was
eleven
years
old
i
always
had
that
dream
like
my
daddy
before
me
so
i
started
writing
songs
i
started
writing
stories
something
about
that
glory
just
always
seemed
to
bore
me
'cause
only
those
i

in

peace
of

i

it's
hard
sometimes
yeah
i
think
about
the
end
just
way
too
much
but
it's
fun
to
fantasize
on
my
enemies
who
wouldn't
wish
who
i
was

it's

&quot;i'd
die
for
you&quot;
that's
easy
to

we
have
a
list

people
that
we
would
take
a
bullet
for
them
a
bullet
for
you
a

for
everybody
in

many
bullets
coming
through
see
many
bullets
coming

i'm

man

literally
i
don't
know
what
i'd
do
&quot;i'd
live
for
you&quot;
and
that's
hard
to
do
even
harder
to
say
when
you
know
it's
not
true
even
harder
to
write
when
you
know
that
tonight
there
were
people
back
home
who
tried
talking
to
you
but
then
you
ignored
them
still
all
these
questions
they're
for
real
like
&quot;who
would
you
live
for&quot;
&quot;who
would
you
die
for&quot;
and
&quot;would
you
ever

your
friends
don't
know
if
you
wanted
me
you
would
just
say
so
and
if

would
never
let
me
go
[olivia

i
don't
mean
no
harm
i
just
miss
you
on
my
arm
wedding
bells
were
just
alarms
caution
tape
around
my
heart
you
ever
wonder
what
we
could
have
been
you
said
you
wouldn't
and
you
fucking
did
lie
to
me
lie
with
me
get
your
fucking
fix
now
all
my
drinks
and
all
my
feelings
are
all
fucking
mixed
always
missing
people
that
i
shouldn't
be
missing
sometimes
you
gotta
burn
some
bridges
just
to
create
some
distance
i
know
that
i
control
my
thoughts
and
i
should
stop
reminiscing
but
i
learned
from
my
dad
that
it's
good
to
have
feelings
when
love
and
trust
are
gone
i
guess
this
is
moving
on
everyone
i
do
right
does
me
wrong
so
every
lonely
night
i
sing
this
song
[olivia

hate
you
i
love
you

i
love
you

i
want
you
you
want
her
you
need
her
and
i'll
never
be
her
all
alone
i
watch
you
watch
her
like
she's
the
only
girl
you've
ever
seen
you
don't
care
you
never
did
you
don't
give
a
damn
about
me
[olivia
o'brien
and
gnash:]
yeah
all
alone
i
watch
you
watch
her
she
is
the
only
thing
you
ever
see
how
is
it
you
never
notice
that
you
are
slowly
killing
me
[olivia

i
hate
you
i
love
you
i

i
guess
right
now
you've
got
the
last
laugh
i'm
sorry
if
i
seem
uninterested
or
i'm
not
listenin'
or
i'm
indifferent
truly
i
ain't
got
no
business
here
but
since
my
friends
are
here
i
just
came
to
kick
it
but
really
i
would
rather
be
at
home
all
by
myself
not
in
this
room
with
people
who
don't
even
care
about
my
well-being
i
don't
dance
don't
ask
i
don't
need
a
boyfriend
so
you
can
go
back
please
enjoy
your
party
i'll
be
here
somewhere
in
the
corner
under
clouds
of
marijuana
with
this
boy
who's
hollering
i
can
hardly
hear
over
this
music
i
don't
listen
to
and
i
don't
wanna
get
with
you
so
tell
my
friends
that
i'll
be
over
here
oh
oh
oh
here
oh
oh
oh
here
oh
oh
oh
i
ask
myself
what
am
i
doing
here
oh
oh
oh
here
oh
oh
oh
here
and
i
can't
wait
till
we
can
break
up
outta
here
excuse
me
if
i
seem
a
little
unimpressed
with
this
an
anti-social
pessimist
but
usually
i
don't
mess
with
this
and
i
know
you
mean
only
the
best
and
your
intentions
aren't
to
bother
me
but
honestly
i'd
rather
be
somewhere
with
my
people
we
can
kick
it
and
just
listen
to
some
music
with
a
message
like
we
usually
do
and
we'll
discuss
our
big
dreams
how
we
plan
to
take
over
the
planet
so
pardon
my
manners
i
hope
you'll
understand
it
that
i'll
be
here
not
there
in
the
kitchen
with
the
girl
who's
always
gossiping
about
her
friends
so
tell
them
i'll
be
here
right
next
to
the
boy
who's
throwing
up
'cause
he
can't
take
what's
in
his
cup
no
more
oh
god
why
am
i
here
oh
oh
oh
here
oh
oh
oh
here
oh
oh
oh
i
ask
myself
what
am
i
doing
here
oh
oh
oh
here
oh
oh
oh
here
and
i
can't
wait
till
we
can
break
up
outta
here
hours
later
congregating
next
to
the
refrigerator
some
girl's
talking
'bout
her
haters
she
ain't
got
none
how
did
it
ever
come
to
this
i
shoulda
never
come
to
this
so
holla
at
me
i'll
be
in
the
car
when
you're
done
i'm
standoffish
don't
want
what
you're
offering
and
i'm
done
talking
awfully
sad
it
had
to
be
that
way
so
tell
my
people
when
they're
ready
that
i'm
ready
and
i'm
standing
by
the
tv
with
my
beanie
low
yo
i'll
be
over

i'm

call
away
from
walking
home
and
talking
loads
to
seeing
shows
in
evening
clothes
with
you
from
nervous
touch
and
getting
drunk
to
staying
up
and
waking
up
with
you
but
now
we're
sleeping
at
the
edge
holding
something
we
don't
need
all
this
delusion
in
our
heads
is
gonna
bring
us
to
our
knees
so
come
on
let
it
go
just
let
it
be
why
don't
you
be
you
and
i'll
be
me
everything
that's
broke
leave
it
to
the
breeze
why
don't
you
be
you
and
i'll
be
me
and
i'll
be
me
from
throwing
clothes
across
the
floor
to
teeth
and
claws
and
slamming
doors
at
you
if
this
is
all
we're
living
for
why
are
we
doing
it
doing
it
doing
it
anymore
i
used
to
recognize
myself
it's
funny
how
reflections
change
when
we're
becoming
something
else
i
think
it's
time
to
walk
away
so
come
on
let
it
go
just
let
it
be
why
don't
you
be
you
and
i'll
be
me
everything
that's
broke
leave
it

why
don't
you
be
you
and
i'll
be
me
and
i'll
be
me
tryna
fit
your
hand
inside
of
mine
when
we
know
it
just
don't
belong
there's
no
force
on
earth
could
make
it
feel
right
no
whoa
tryna
push
this
problem
up
the
hill
when
it's
just
too
heavy
to
hold
think
now's
the
time
to
let
it
slide
so
come
on
let
it
go
just
let
it
be
why
don't
you
be
you
and
i'll
be
me
everything
that's
broke
leave
it
to
the
breeze
let
the
ashes
fall
forget
about
me
come
on
let
it
go
just
let
it
be
why
don't
you
be
you
and
i'll
be
me
and
i'll
be
me
[zara
larsson:]
i
used
to
be
so
happy
but
without
you
here
i
feel
so
low
i
watched
you
as
you
left
but
i
can
never
seem
to
let
you
go
'cause
once
upon
a
time
you
were
my
everything
it's
clear
to
see
that
time
hasn't
changed
a
thing
it's
buried
deep
inside
me
but
i
feel
there's
something
you
should
know
i
will
never
forget
you
you'll
always
be
by
my

[mnek:]
funny
how
we
both
end
up
here

everything
seems
so
right
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
we
went
back

put
up
a

what
in

would
go
away

one
night
as
i
closed
my
eyes
i
saw
a
shadow
flying
high
he
came
to
me
with
the
sweetest
smile
told
me
he
wanted
to
talk
for
awhile

said
&quot;peter

one
condition
is
say
you'll

standin'
in

starin'
at
the
sunset

we
do&quot;
his
hands
are
in
my
hair
his
clothes
are
in
my
room
and
his
voice
is
a
familiar
sound
nothin'
lasts
forever
but
this
is
gettin'
good
now
he's
so
tall
and
handsome
as
hell
he's
so
bad

does
it
so
well

when
we've
had
our
very
last
kiss
