i
got
my
driver's
license
last
week
just
like
we
always
talked
about
'cause
you
were
so
excited
for
me
to
finally
drive
up
to
your
house
but
today
i
drove
through
the
suburbs
crying
'cause
you
weren't
around
and
you're
probably
with
that
blonde
girl
who
always
made
me
doubt
she's
so
much
older
than
me
she's
everything
i'm
insecure
about
yeah
today
i
drove
through
the
suburbs
'cause
how
could
i
ever
love
someone
else
and
i
know
we
weren't
perfect
but
i've
never
felt
this
way
for
no
one
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
you
could
be
so
okay
now
that
i'm
gone
guess
you
didn't
mean
what
you
wrote
in
that
song
about
me
'cause
you
said
forever
now
i
drive
alone
past
your
street
and
all
my
friends
are
tired
of
hearing
how
much
i
miss
you
but
i
kinda
feel
sorry
for
them
'cause
they'll
never
know
you
the
way
that
i
do
yeah
today
i
drove
through
the
suburbs
and
pictured
i
was
driving
home
to
you
and
i
know
we
weren't
perfect
but
i've
never
felt
this
way
for
no
one
oh
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
you
could
be
so
okay
now
that
i'm
gone
i
guess
you
didn't
mean
what
you
wrote
in
that
song
about
me
'cause
you
said
forever
now
i
drive
alone
past
your
street
red
lights
stop
signs
i
still
see
your
face
in
the
white
cars
front
yards
can't
drive
past
the
places
we
used
to
go
to
'cause
i
still
fucking
love
you
babe
sidewalks
we
crossed
i
still
hear
your
voice
in
the
traffic
we're
laughing
over
all
the
noise
god
i'm
so
blue
know
we're
through
but
i
still
fucking
love
you
babe
i
know
we
weren't
perfect
but
i've
never
felt
this
way
for
no
one
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
you
could
be
so
okay
now
that
i'm
gone
guess
you
didn't
mean
what
you
wrote
in
that
song
about
me
'cause

deep
search
anxiety
killin'
me
i
just
want
to
leave
earth
when
they
ask
if
i'm
okay
it
just
make
everything
seem
worse
try
and
explain
your
feelings
sound
like
something
you
rehearsed
stabbed
me
in
my
back
with
a
clean
smirk
lookin'
so
deep
into
your
eyes
i
can
read
your
thoughts
so
shut
the
fuck-
i
mean
please
don't
talk
i
done
been
through
too
much
and
i
don't
need
another
loss
put

on
every
war
scar
for
every

that
you
were
thinking
'bout
someone
else
you're
drunk
at
a

you
tell

where'd
you
get
the
nerve

all
that
we
had
but

how
bad
it
hurts
when
you
broke
me
first

broke
me
first
took
awhile
was
in
denial
when
i
first
heard
that
you
moved
on
quicker
than
i
could've
ever
you
know
that
hurt
swear
for
a
while
i
would
stare
at
my
phone
just
to
see
your

it's
there

ah
brown
guilty
eyes
and
little
white
lies
yeah
i
played
dumb
but
i
always
knew
that
you
talked
to
her
maybe
did
even
worse
i
kept
quiet
so
i
could
keep
you
and
ain't
it
funny
how
you
ran
to
her
the
second
that
we
called
it
quits
and
ain't
it
funny
how
you
said
you
were
friends
now
it
sure
as
hell
don't
look
like
it
you
betrayed
me
and
i
know
that
you'll
never
feel
sorry
for
the
way
i
hurt
yeah
you
talked
to
her
when
we
were
together
loved
you
at
your
worst
but
that
didn't
matter
it
took
you
two
weeks
to
go
off
and
date
her
guess
you
didn't
cheat
but
you're
still
a
traitor
now
you
bring
her
around
just
to
shut
me
down
show
her
off
like
she's
a
new
trophy
and
i
know
if
you
were
true
there's
no
damn
way
that
you
could
fall
in
love
with
somebody
that
quickly
ain't
it
funny
all
the
twisted
games
all
the
questions
you
used
to
avoid
ain't
it
funny
remember
i
brought
her
up
and
you
told
me
i
was
paranoid
you
betrayed
me
and
i
know
that
you'll
never
feel
sorry
for
the
way
i
hurt
yeah
you
talked
to
her
when
we
were
together
loved
you
at
your
worst
but
that
didn't
matter
it
took
you
two
weeks
to
go
off
and
date
her
guess
you
didn't
cheat
but
you're
still
a
traitor
god
i
wish
that
you
had
thought
this
through
before
i
went
and
fell
in
love
with
you
when
she's
sleeping
in
the
bed
we
made
don't
you
dare
forget
about
the
way
you
betrayed
me
'cause
i
know
that
you'll
never
feel
sorry
for
the
way
i
hurt
yeah
you
talked
to
her
when
we
were
together
you
gave
me
your
word
but
that
didn't

nights
might
feel
cold
and
dark
when
nobody
wins
afraid
of
losing
and
the
hard
roads
are
the
ones
worth
choosing
some
day

my

life
was
a
willow
and
it
bent
right
to
your
wind
head
on
the
pillow
i
could
feel
you
sneaking
in
as
if
you
were
a
mythical
thing
like
you
were
a
trophy

a
champion
ring

strange
like
lookin'
in
a
mirror
tryna
steady
yourself
and
seeing
somebody
else
and
everything
is
not
the
same
now
it
feels
like
all
our
lives
have
changed
maybe
when
i'm
older
it'll
all
calm
down
but
it's
killing
me
now
what
if
you
had
it
all
but
nobody
to
call
maybe
then
you'd
know

i've
had
everything
but
no
one's
listening

everybody
knows
my
past
now
like
my
house
was
always
made
of
glass
and
maybe
that's
the
price
you
pay
for
the
money
and
fame
at
an
early
age
and
everybody
saw
me
sick
and
it
felt
like
no
one
gave
a
shit
they
criticized
the
things
i
did
as
an
idiot
kid
what
if
you
had
it
all
but
nobody
to
call
maybe
then
you'd
know
me
'cause
i've
had
everything
but
no
one's
listening
and
that's
just

you're
gonna
find
yourself
somewhere
somehow
blue
as
the
sky
sunburnt
and
lonely
sipping
tea
in
the
bar
by
the
roadside
just
relax
just
relax
don't
you
let
those
other
boys
fool
you
gotta
love
that
afro
hairdo
maybe
sometimes
we
feel
afraid
but
it's
all
right
the
more
you
stay
the
same
the
more
that
they
seem
to
change

your
favorite
song

your
hair

and
faded
jeans

your
dreams
just
go
ahead
let
your
hair
down
you're
gonna
find
yourself
somewhere
somehow
just
more
than
i
could
take
pity
for
pity's
sake
some
nights
kept
me
awake
i
thought
that
i
was
stronger
when
you
gonna
realize
that
you
don't
even
have
to
try
any
longer
do
what
you
want
to
girl
put
your
records
on
tell
me
your
favorite
song

get
your
dreams
just
go
ahead
let
your
hair
down
you're
gonna
find
yourself
somewhere
somehow
when
i'm
away
from
you
i'm
happier
than
ever
wish
i
could
explain
it
better
i
wish
it
wasn't
true
give
me
a
day
or
two
to
think
of
something
clever
to
write
myself
a
letter
to
tell
me
what
to
do
do
you
read
my
interviews
or
do
you
skip
my
avenue
when
you
said
you
were
passing
through
was
i
even
on
your
way
i
knew
when
i
asked
you
to
be
cool
about
what
i
was
telling
you
you'd
do
the
opposite
of
what
you
said
you'd
do
and
i'd
end
up
more
afraid
don't
say
it
isn't
fair
you
clearly
weren't
aware
that
you
made
me
miserable
so
if
you
really
wanna
know
when
i'm
away
from
you
i'm
happier
than
ever
wish
i
could
explain
it
better
i
wish
it
wasn't
true
you
call
me
again
drunk
in
your
benz
driving
home
under
the
influence
you
scared
me
to
death
but
i'm
wasting
my
breath
'cause
you
only
listen
to
your
fucking
friends
i
don't
relate
to
you
i
don't
relate
to
you
no
'cause
i'd
never
treat
me
this
shitty
you
made
me
hate
this
city
and
i
don't
talk
shit
about
you
on
the
internet
never
told
anyone
anything
bad
'cause
that
shit's
embarrassing
you
were
my
everything
and
all
that
you
did
was
make
me
fucking
sad
so
don't
waste
the
time
i
don't
have
and
don't
try
to
make
me
feel
bad
i
could
talk
about
every
time
that
you
showed
up
on
time
but
i'd
have
an
empty
line
'cause
you
never
did
never
paid
any
mind
to
my
mother
or
friends
so
i
shut
'em
all
out
for
you
'cause
i
was
a
kid
you
ruined
everything
good
always
said
you
were
misunderstood
made
all
my
moments
your
own
just
fucking
leave
me
alone
i
was
out
taking
shots
throwing
down
at
the
spot
three
sheets
just
me
and
the
guys
every
single
saturday
night
i
was
killing
time
crushing
cans
trying
not
to
catch
a
tan
'cause
i
was
under
them
neon
lights
every
single
saturday
night
yeah
everybody
knew
they
could
find
me
there
and
right
out
of
the
blue
right
out
of
nowhere
out
of
nowhere
sitting
over
in
the
corner
baby
i
saw

red
lips
working
on
a
white
claw
shaking
to
a
little
shook
me
all
night

me

me

but
they
all

it
'cause
they
