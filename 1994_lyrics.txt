have
to
be
afraid
of
what
you

reaches
out
a
hand
for
you
to
hold

can
find
love
if
you
search
within
yourself
and
the
emptiness
you
felt

disappear

from
a
friend
today
and
she
said
you
were
in
town
suddenly
the
memories
came
back
to
me
in
my
mind
&quot;how
can
i
be
strong&quot;
i've
asked
myself
time
and
time
i've
said
that
i'll
never
fall
in
love
with
you
again
a
wounded
heart
you
gave
my
soul
you
took
away
good
intentions
you
had
many
i
know
you
did
i've
come
from
a
place
that
hurts
and
god
knows
how
i've
cried
and
i
never
want
to
return
never
fall
again
making
love
to
you
oh
it
felt
so
good
and
oh
so
right
&quot;how
can
i
be
strong&quot;
i've
asked
myself
time
and
time
i've
said
that
i'll
never
fall
in
love
with
you
again
so
here
we
are
alone
again
didn't
think
it'd
come
to
this
and
to
know
it
all
began
with
just
a
little
kiss
i've
come
too
close
to
happiness
to
have
it
swept
away
don't
think
i
can
take
the
pain
never
fall
again
kinda
late
in
the
game
and
my
heart
is
in
your
hands
don't
you
stand
there
and
then
tell
me
you
love
me
then
leave
again
'cause
i'm
falling
in
love
with
you
again
hold
me

me
don't
ever
let
me
go
say
it
just
one
time
say
you
love
me
god
knows
i
do
love
you
again
say
goodbye
to
not
knowing
when
the
truth
in
my
whole
life
began
say
goodbye
to
not
knowing
how
to
cry
you
taught
me
that
and
i'll
remember
the
strength
that
you
gave
me
now
that
i'm
standing
on
my
own
i'll
remember
the
way
that
you
saved
me
i'll
remember
inside
i
was
a
child
that
could
not
mend
a
broken
wing
outside
i
looked
for
a
way
to
teach
my
heart
to
sing
and
i'll
remember
the
love
that
you
gave
me
now
that
i'm
standing
on
my
own
i'll
remember
the
way
that
you
changed
me
i'll
remember
i
learned
to
let
go
of
the
illusion
that
we
can
possess
i
learned
to
let
go
i
travel
in
stillness
and
i'll
remember
happiness
i'll
remember
i'll
remember
i'll
remember
and
i'll
remember
the
love
that
you
gave
me
now
that
i'm
standing
on
my
own
i'll
remember
the
way
that
you
changed
me
i'll
remember
i'll
remember
no
i've
never
been
afraid
to
cry
now
i
finally
have
a
reason
why
i'll
remember

much
respect
due
to
the
man
that's

flows
on
the
down
low
cuz
i
never
heard
about
him
with
another
girl
but
i
don't
sweat
it
because
it's
just
pathetic
to
let
it
get
me
involved
in
that
he
said/she
said
crowd
i
know
that

believe
me
y'all
he's
worth
it
so
here's
to
the
future
cuz
we
got
through
the
past
i
finally
found
somebody
that
can
make
me
laugh
ha
ha
ha
you
so
crazy
i
think
i
wanna
have
your
baby
[chorus]
my
man
is
smooth
like
barry
and
his
voice
got
bass
a
body
like
arnold
with
a
denzel
face
he's
smart
like
a
doctor
with
a
real
good
rep
and
when
he
comes
home
he's
relaxed
with
pep
he
always
got
a
gift
for
me
everytime
i
see
him
a
lot
of
snot-nosed
ex-flames
couldn't
be
him
he
never
ran
a
corny
line
once
to
me
yet
so
i
give
him
stuff
that
he'll
never
forget
he
keeps
me
on
cloud
nine
just
like
the
temps
he's
not
a
fake
wannabe
tryin'
to
be
a
pimp
he
dresses
like
a
dapper
don
but
even
in
jeans
he's
a
god-sent
original
the
man
of
my
dreams
yes
my
man
says
he
loves
me
never
says
he
loves
me
not
tryin'
to
rush
me
good
and
touch
me
in
the
right
spot
see
other
guys
that
i've
had
they
tried
to
play
all
that
mac
shit
but
every
time
they
tried
i
said
&quot;that's
not
it&quot;
but
not
this
man
he's
got
the
right
potion
baby
rub
it
down
and
make
it
smooth
like
lotion

burn
down

there
was
this
kid
who
got
into
an
accident
and
couldn't
come
to
school
but
when
he
finally
came
back
his
hair
had
turned
from
black
into
bright
white
he
said
that
it
was
from
when
the
cars
had
smashed
so
hard
mmm
mmm
mmm
mmm
mmm

once
there
was
this
girl
who
wouldn't
go
and
change
with
the
girls
in
the
change
room
and
when
they
finally
made
her
they
saw
birthmarks
all
over
her
body
she
couldn't
quite
explain
it
they'd
always
just
been
there
mmm
mmm
mmm
mmm
mmm
mmm
mmm

both
girl
and
boy
were
glad
'cause
one
kid
had
it
worse
than
that
'cause
then
there
was
this
boy
whose
parents
made
him
come
directly
home
right
after
school
and
when
they
went
to
their
church
they
shook
and
lurched
all
over
the
church
floor
he
couldn't
quite
explain
it
they'd
always
just
gone
there

corin
some
say
the
blacker
the
berry
the
sweeter
the
juice
i
say
the
darker
the
flesh
then
the
deeper
the
roots
i
give
a
holla
to
my
sisters
on
welfare
2pac
cares
if
don't
nobody
else
care
and
i
know
they
like
to
beat
you
down
a
lot
when
you
come
around
the
block
brothers
clown
a
lot
but
please
don't
cry
dry
your
eyes
never
let
up
forgive
but
don't
forget
girl
keep
your
head
up
and
when
he
tells
you
you
ain't
nothing
don't
believe
him
and
if
he
can't
learn
to
love
you
you
should
leave
him
'cause
sister
you
don't
need
him
and
i
ain't
trying
to
gas
ya
up
i
just
call
'em
how
i
see
'em
you
know
what
makes
me
unhappy
when
brothers
make
babies
and
leave
a
young
mother
to
be
a
pappy
and
since
we
all
came
from
a
woman
got
our
name
from
a
woman
and
our
game
from
a
woman
i
wonder
why
we
take
from
our
women
why
we
rape
our
women
do
we
hate
our
women
i
think
it's
time
to
kill
for
our
women
time
to
heal
our
women
be
real
to
our
women
and
if
we
don't
we'll
have
a
race
of
babies
that
will
hate
the
ladies
that
make
the
babies
and
since
a
man
can't
make
one
he
has
no
right
to
tell
a
woman
when
and
where
to
create
one
so
will
the
real
men
get
up
i
know
you're
fed
up
ladies
but
keep
your
head
up
keep
ya
head
up
ooh
child
things
are
gonna
get
easier
keep
ya
head
up
ooh
child
things'll
get
brighter
keep
ya
head
up
ooh
child
things
are
gonna
get
easier
keep
ya
head
up
ooh
child
things'll
get
brighter
ayo
i
remember
marvin
gaye
used
to
sing
to
me
he
had
me
feeling
like
black
was
the
thing
to
be
and
suddenly
the
ghetto
didn't
seem
so
tough
and
though
we
had
it
rough
we
always
had
enough
i
huffed
and
puffed
about
my
curfew
and
broke
the
rules
ran
with
the
local
crew
and
had
a
smoke
or
two
and
i
realize
momma
really
paid
the
price
she
nearly
gave
her
life
to
raise
me
right
and
all
i
had
to
give
her
was
my
pipe
dream
of
how
i'd
rock
the
mic
and
make
it
to
the
bright
screen
i'm
trying
to
make
a
dollar
out
of
fifteen
cents
it's
hard
to
be
legit
and
still
pay
the
rent
and
in
the
end
it
seems
i'm
heading
for
the
pen
i
try
to
find
my
friends
but
they're
blowing
in
the
wind
last
night
my
buddy
lost
his
whole
family
it's
gonna
take
the
man
in
me
to
conquer
this
insanity
it
seems
the
rain'll
never
let
up
i
try
to
keep
my
head
up
and
still
keep
from
getting
wet
up
you
know
it's
funny
when
it
rains
it
pours
they
got
money
for
wars
but
can't
feed
the
poor
say
there
ain't
no
hope
for
the
youth
and
the
truth
is
it
ain't
no
hope
for
the
future
and
then
they
wonder
why
we
crazy
i
blame
my
mother
for
turning
my
brother
into
a
crack
baby
we
ain't
meant
to
survive
'cause
it's
a
set-up
and
even
though
you're
fed
up
huh
you
got
to
keep
your
head
up
keep
ya
head
up
ooh
child
things
are
gonna
get
easier
keep
ya
head
up
ooh
child
things'll
get
brighter
keep
ya
head
up
ooh
child
things
are
gonna
get
easier
keep
ya
head
up
ooh
child
things'll
get
brighter
and
uh

lonesome

'em
'cause
i
think

can
make
it
in
fact
i'm
sure
and
if
you
fall
stand
tall
and
comeback
for
more
'cause

nothing
worse

to
know
why
his
daddy
don't
love
him
no
mo'

can't
complain

too
many
things
for
you

inside

looking

there
were
times
in
my
life
when
i
was
goin'
insane
tryin'
to
walk
through
the
pain
when
i
lost
my
grip
and
i
hit
the
floor
yeah
i
thought
i
could
leave
but
couldn't
get
out
the
door
i
was
so
sick
and
tired
of
livin'
a
lie
i
was
wishin
that
i
would
die

amazing
with
the
blink
of
an
eye
you
finally
see
the

when
the
moment
arrives
that
you
know
you'll
be
alright

i'm
sayin'
a
prayer
for
the
desperate
hearts
tonight
that
one
last
shot's
a
permanent
vacation

how
high
can
you
fly
with
broken
wings
life's
a
journey
not
a
destination
and
i
just
can't
tell
just
what
tomorrow
brings
you
have
to
learn
to
crawl
before
you
learn
to
walk

i
just
couldn't
listen
to
all
that
righteous
talk
oh
yeah
i
was
out
on
the
street
just
tryin'
to
survive
scratchin'
to
stay
alive
it's
amazing
with
the

of
an
eye
you
finally

i
guess
i'm
not
that
good
anymore
but
baby

just
me
and
i
will
love
you
baby
always
and
i'll
be
there
forever

day
always
i'll
be

'til
the
stars
don't
shine
'til
the
heavens
burst
and
the
words
don't
rhyme
and
i
know
when
i
die
you'll
be
on
my
mind
and
i'll
love
you
always
now
your
pictures
that
you
left
behind
are
just
memories
of
a
different
life
some
that
made
us
laugh
some
that
made
us
cry
one
that
made
you
have
to
say
goodbye
what
i'd
give
to
run
my
fingers
through
your
hair
to
touch
your
lips
to
hold
you
near
when
you
say
your
prayers
try
to
understand
i've
made
mistakes
i'm
just
a
man
when
he
holds
you
close
when
he
pulls
you
near
when
he
says
the
words
you've
been
needing
to
hear
i'll
wish
i
was
him
'cause
those
words
are
mine
to
say
to
you
'til
the
end
of
time
and
i
will
love
you
baby
always
and
i'll
be
there
forever
and
a
day
always
if
you
told
me
to
cry
for
you
i
could
if
you
told
me
to
die
for
you
i
would
take
a
look
at
my
face
there's
no
price
i
won't
pay
to
say
these
words
to
you
well
there
ain't
no
luck
in
these
loaded
dice
but
baby
if
you
give
me
just
one
more
try
we
can
pack
up
our
old
dreams
and
our
old
lives
we'll
find
a
place
where
the
sun
still
shines
and
i
will
love
you
baby
always
and
i'll
be
there
forever
and
a
day
always
i'll
be
there
'til
the
stars
don't
shine
'til
the
heavens
burst
and
the
words
don't
rhyme
and
i
know
when
i
die
you'll
be
on
my
mind
and
i'll
love
you
always

leads
me
to
another
flow
everytime
i
hear
a
brother
call
a
girl
a
bitch
or
a
ho
trying
to
make
a
sister
feel
low
you
know
all
of
that
gots

knows
there's
exceptions
to
this
rule
now

be
getting
mad
when
we
playing
it's
cool
but

you
be
calling
out
my
name
i
bring
wrath
to
those
who
disrespect
me
like
a
dame
that's
why
i'm
talking
one
day
i
was
walking
down
the
block
i
had
my
cutoff
shorts
on
right
cause
it
was
crazy
hot
i
walked
past
these
dudes
when
they
passed
me
one
of
'em
felt
my
booty
he
was
nasty
i
turned
around
red
somebody
was
catching
the
wrath
then
the
little
one
said
yeah
me
bitch
and
laughed
since
he
was
with
his
boys
he
tried
to
break
fly
huh
i
punched
him
dead
in
his
eye
and
said
&quot;who
you
calling
a
bitch&quot;
here
we
go
u.n.i.t.y.

what

we
fell
in
love
and
who
could
blame
us
the
word
was
we
were
just
beside
ourselves
and
everybody
said
it
wouldn't
last
now
they
wonder
why
we
didn't
last
we
fell
in
love
it
seemed
so
righteous
couldn't
compare
our
love
to
no
one
else
and
everybody
thought
we
could
not
win
it's
no
wonder
love
came
to
an
end
and
our
feelings
just
aren't
feelings
anymore
they're
just
words
that
come
from
whispers
from
people
we
don't
know
and
our
feelings
just
aren't
feelings
anymore
they're
just
words
without
emotion
from
people
who
don't
know
we
fell
apart
the
bond
was
broken
should've
kept
our
thoughts
between
ourselves
and
though
they
say
they
cared
they
didn't
help
makes
me
wonder
should
we
blame
ourselves
so
here
we
are
broken
hearted
what
in
the
world
have
we
done
to
ourselves
when
everybody
said
to
let
it
end
it
makes
me
wonder
we
can't
let
them
win
[hook]
if
we'd
only
just
try
we
could
make
it
by
and
maybe
in
time
we
could
make
it
right
if
we
only
had
done
what
we
shoulda
done
we'd
both
be
here
still
making
love
i
wanna
know
that
that
we
can
go
back
back
to
the
times
when
the
lovin'
was
all
that
when
no
one
could
come
between
our
love
