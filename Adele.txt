hello
it's
me
i
was
wondering
if
after
all
these
years
you'd
like
to
meet
to
go
over
everything
they
say
that
time's
supposed
to
heal
ya
but
i
ain't
done
much
healing
hello
can
you
hear
me
i'm
in
california
dreaming
about
who
we
used
to
be
when
we
were
younger
and
free
i've
forgotten
how
it
felt
before
the
world
fell
at
our
feet


there's
such
a
difference
between
us
and
a
million
miles

hello
from
the
other
side
i
must've
called
a
thousand
times
to
tell
you
i'm
sorry
for
everything
that
i've
done
but
when
i
call
you
never
seem
to
be
home
hello
from
the
outside
at
least
i
can
say
that
i've
tried
to
tell
you
i'm
sorry
for
breaking
your
heart
but
it
don't
matter
it
clearly
doesn't
tear
you
apart
anymore


hello
how
are
you
it's
so
typical
of
me
to
talk
about
myself
i'm
sorry
i
hope
that
you're
well
did
you
ever
make
it
out
of
that
town
where
nothing
ever
happened

both
of
us
are
running
out

time

so

one
become
so
bounded
by

that
somebody

makes
how
come
we've
both
become
a
version
of
a
person
we
don't
even
like
we're
in
love
with
the

the
world
just
wants
to
bring
us
down
by
puttin'
ideas
in
our
heads
that
corrupt
our
hearts
somehow
when
i
was

every
single
thing
could
blow
my
mind
soaking
it
all
up
for
fun
but
now
i
only
soak
up
wine
they
say
to
play
hard
you
work
hard
find
balance
in
the
sacrifice
and

i
don't

i
only
wanted
to
have
fun
learning
to
fly
learning
to
run
i
let
my
heart
decide
the
way
when
i
was
young
deep
down
i
must
have
always
known
that
this
would
be
inevitable
to
earn
my
stripes
i'd
have
to
pay
and
bare
my
soul


i
know
i'm
not
the
only
one
who
regrets
the
things
they've
done
sometimes
i
just
feel
it's
only
me
who
can't
stand
the
reflection
that
they
see
i
wish
i
could
live
a
little
more
look
up
to
the
sky
not
just
the
floor
i
feel
like
my
life
is
flashing
by
and
all
i
can
do
is
watch
and
cry
i
miss
the

i
miss

my

they
can't
look
me
in
the

it's

they're
scared
of
me
i
try
to
think
of
things
to

a

they
don't
recognize
me

i'm
