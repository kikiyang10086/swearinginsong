more
than
three
short
years

i
was
abandoned
and
alone
without
a
penny
to
my
name
so
very
young
and
so
afraid
no
proper
shoes
upon
my
feet
sometimes
i
couldn't
even
eat
i
often
cried
myself
to
sleep
but
still
i
had
to
keep
on
going
never
knowing
if
i
could
take
it
if
i
would
make
it
through
the
night
i
held
on
to
my
faith
i
struggled
and
i
prayed
and
now
i've
found
my
way
if
you
believe
in
yourself
enough
and
know
what
you
want
you're
gonna
make
it
happen

your
life
away

used
to
feel
the
way
you
do
still
i
had
to
keep
on
going
never
knowing
if
i
could
take
it
if

would
make
it

i
saw
you
dancin'
out
the
ocean
runnin'
fast
along
the
sand
a
spirit
born
of
earth
and
water
fire
flyin'
from
your
hands
in
the
instant
that
you
love
someone
in
the
second
that
the
hammer
hits
reality
runs
up
your
spine
and
the
pieces
finally
fit
and
all
i
ever
needed
was
the
one
like
freedom
fields
where
wild
horses
run
when
stars
collide
like
you
and
i
no
shadows
block
the
sun
you're
all
i've
ever
needed
baby
you're
the
one
there
are
caravans
we
follow
drunken
nights
in
dark
hotels
when
chances
breathe
between
the
silence
where
sex
and
love
no
longer
gel
oh
for
each
man
in
his
time
is
cain
until
he
walks
along
the
beach
and
sees
his
future
in
the
water
a
long
lost
heart
within
his
reach
and
all
i
ever
needed
was
the
one
like
freedom
fields
where
wild
horses
run
when
stars
collide
like
you
and
i
no
shadows
block
the
sun
you're
all
i've
ever
needed
ooh
baby
you're
the
one
and
all
i
ever
needed
was
the
one
like
freedom
fields
where
wild
horses
run
when
stars
collide
like
you
and
i
no
shadows
block
the
sun
oh
you're
all
i
ever
needed
ooh
baby
you're
the
one
all
i
ever
needed
was
the
one
like
freedom
fields
where
wild
horses
run
when
stars
collide
like
you
and
i
no
shadows
block
the
sun
oh
you're
all
i
ever
needed
ooh
baby
you're
the
one
set
adrift
on
memory
bliss
of
you
baby
you
send
me
baby
you
send
me
set
adrift
on
memory
bliss
of
you
the
camera
pans
to
a
cocktail
glass
behind
a
blind
of
plastic
plants
i
found
the
lady
with
the
fat
diamond
ring
then
you
know
i
can't
remember
a
damn
thing
i
think
its
one
of
those
dxc3xa9jxc3xa0
vu
things
or
a
dream
that's
trying
to
tell
me
something
or
will
i
ever
stop
thinking
about
it
i
don't
know
i
doubt
it
subterranean
by
design
i
wonder
what
i
would
find
if
i
met
you
let
my
eyes
caress
you
until
i
meet
the
thought
of
misses
princess
who
often
wonder
what
makes
her
work
i
guess
i'll
leave
that
question
to
the
experts
assuming
that
there
are
some
out
there
they're
probably
alone
solitaire
i
can
remember
when
i
caught
up
with
a
past-time
intimate
friend
she
said
&quot;bet
you're
probably
gonna
say
i
look
lovely
but
you
probably
don't
think
nothin'
of
me.&quot;
she
was
right
though
i
can't
lie
she's
just
one
of
those
corners
in
my
mind
and
i
just
put
her
right
back
with
the
rest
that's
the
way
it
goes
i
guess
baby
you
send
me
baby
you
send
me
set
adrift
on
memory
bliss
of
you
baby
you
send
me
baby
you
send
me
set
adrift
on
memory
bliss
of
you
careless
whisper
from
a
careless
man
a

mother
came
to
hazard
when
i
was
just
seven
even

folks
in
town
would
say
with
prejudiced
eyes
&quot;that
boy's
not
right&quot;
three
years
ago
when
i
came
to
know
mary

time

someone
looked
beyond
the
rumors
and
the
lies
and
saw
the
man
inside
we
used
to
walk
down
by
the
river
she
loved
to
watch
the
sun
go
down
we
used
to
walk
along
the
river
and
dream
our
way
out
of
this
town
no
one
understood
what
i
felt
for
mary
no
one
cared
until
the
night
she
went

dare
me
well
the
key
to
my
survival
was
never
in
much
doubt
the
question
was
how
i
could
keep
sane
trying
to
find
a
way
out
things
were
never
easy
for
me
peace
of
mind
was
hard
to
find
and
i
needed
a
place
where
i
could
hide
somewhere
i
could
call
mine
i
didn't
think
much
about
it
til
it
started
happening
all
the
time
soon
i
was
living
with
the
fear
everyday
of
what
might
happen
that
night
i
couldn't
stand
to
hear
the
crying
of
my
mother
and
i
remember
when
i
swore
that
that
would
be
the
last
they'd
see
of
me
and
i
never
went
home
again
they
say
that
time
is
a
healer
and
now
my
wounds
are
not
the
same
i
rang
the
bell
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
had
to
hear
what
he'd
say
he
sat
me
down
to
talk
to
me
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
eyes
he
said:
you're
no
son
you're
no
son
of
mine
you're
no
son
you're
no
son
of
mine
you
walked
out
you
left
us
behind
and
you're
no
son
no
son
of
mine
oh
his
words
how
they
hurt
me
i'll
never
forget
it
and
as
the
time
it
went
by
i
lived
to
regret
it
you're
no
son
you're
no
son
of
mine
but
where
should
i
go
and
what
should
i
do
you're
no
son
you're
no
son
of
mine
but
i
came
here
for
help
oh
i
came
here
for
you
well
the
years
they
passed
so
slowly
i
thought
about
him
everyday
what
would
i
do
if
we
passed
on
the
street
would
i
keep
running
away
in
and
out
of
hiding
places
soon
i'd
have
to
face
the
facts
we'd
have
to
sit
down
and
talk
it
over
and
that
would
mean
going
back
they
say
that
time
is
a
healer
and
now
my
wounds
are
not
the
same
i
rang
that
bell
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
had
to
hear
what
he'd
say
he
sat
me
down
to
talk
to
me
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
eyes
he
said:

son
you're
no
son
of
mine
you're
no
son

walked
out

left
us
behind

no
son

no
son
of

what
about
your
friends
what
about
what
about
your
friends
what
about
what
about
every
now
and
then
i
get
a
little
crazy
that's
not
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be
sometimes
my
vision
is
a
little
hazy
i
can't
tell
who
i
should
trust
or
just
who
i
let
trust
me
people
try
to
say
i
act
a
little
funny
but
that's
just
a
figure
of
speech
to
me
they
tell
me
i
changed
because
i
got
money
but
if
you
were
there
before
then
you're
still
down
with
me
what
about
your
friends
will
they
stand
their
ground
will
they
let
you
down
again
what
about
your
friends
are
they
gonna
be
low
down
will
they
ever
be
around
or
will
they
turn
their
backs
on
you
well
is
it
me
or
can
it
be
i'm
a
little
too
friendly
so
to
speak
hypothetically
say
i
supply
creativity
to
what
others
must
take
as
a
form
of
self-hate
only
to
make
an
enemy
which
results
in
unfortunate
destiny
they
dog
me
out
then
be
next
to
me
just
'cause
i
am
what
some
choose
to
envy
every
now
and
then
i
get
a
little
easy
i
let
a
lot
of
people
depend
on
me
i
never
thought
they
would
ever
deceive
me
don't
you
know
when
times
got
rough
i
was
standing
on
my
own
i'll
never
let
another
get
that
close
to
me
you
see
i've
grown
a
lot
smarter
now
sometimes
you
have
to
choose
and
then
you'll
see
if
your
friends
is
true
they'll
be
there
with
you
through
the
thick
and
thin

your

they

those
times

precious
i
cherish
every
moment
we
spent.
yeah
thinkin'
back
on
all
the
arguments
thinkin'
back
way
back
when
we
kissed
and
made
up
and
all
was
fair
in
love
so
now
we
gotta
go
back
baby
maybe
we
can
turn
the
hands
of
time
going
back
to
when
going
back
to
when
you
were
mine
when
we
were
one
remembering
the
times
when
we
were
one
one
in
love
when
love
was
fun
ohh
baby
baby
dig
it...
remembering
the
first
time
you
showed
me
your
love
the
feeling
was
so
strong
heaven
sent
from
above
but
you
had
no
right
to
play
with
my
heart.
you
showed
no
shame
time
after
time
and
place
after
place
night
after
night
and
day
after
day
i'm
still
missing
your
love
and
the
feelings
we
share
sometimes
i
cry
at
night
cause'
i
feel
so
all
alone.
i
need
your
love
right
here
with
me
to
keep
me
safe
and
warm.
maybe
we
can
turn
the
hands
of
time
i'm
going
back
to
when
going
back
to
when
when
you
were
mine
when
we
were
one...
we
were
one
girl.
ohh
baby
girl...
when
we
were
one...
baby

thinkin
thinkin'
back...

ua...
ohh...
ohh...
i'm
thinkin'
back...
sometimes
we
make
it
harder
than
it
is
we'll
take
a
perfect
night
and
fill
it
up
with
words
we
don't
mean
dark
sides
best
unseen
and
we
wonder
why
we're
feeling
this
way
sometimes
i
wonder
if
we
really
feel
the
same
why
we
can
be
unkind
questioning
the
strongest
of
hearts
that's
when
we
must
start
believing
in
the
one
thing
that
has
gotten
us
this
far
[chorus:]
that's
what
love
is
for
to
help
us

you
and
you
don't
know
why
i'm
there
and
i'm
washed
away
by
emotions
i
hold
deep
down
inside
getting
stronger
with
time
it's
living
through
the
fire
and
holding
on
we

when
i
was
so
afraid
of

some
kind
of
madness
in

buried
deep
in

heart
nobody

this
talking
just
makes
me

[chorus
with
ad
libs]
it's
late
at
night
and
neither
one
of
us
is
sleeping
i
can't
imagine
living
my
life
after
you're
gone
wondering
why
so
many
questions
have
no
answers
i
keep
on
searching
for
the
reason
why
we
went
wrong
where
is
our
yesterday
you
and
i
could
use
it
right
now
but
if
this
is
goodbye
just
take
my
heart
when
you
go
i
don't
have
the
need
for
it
anymore
i'll
always
love
you
but
you're
too
hard
to
hold
just
take
my
heart
when
you
go
here
we
are
'bout
to
take
the
final
step
now
i
just
can't
fool
myself
i
know
there's
no
turning
back
face
to
face
it's
been
an
endless
conversation
but
when
the
love
is
gone
you're
left
with
nothing
but
talk
i'd
give
my
everything
if
only
i
could
turn
you
around
but
if
this
is
goodbye
just
take
my
heart
when
you
go
i
don't
have
the
need
for
it
anymore
i'll
always
love
you
but
you're
too
hard
to
hold
just
take
my
heart
when
you
go
just
take
my
heart
just
take
my
heart
when
you
go
baby
take
my
heart
i
don't
have
the
need
for
it
anymore
i'll
always
love
you
i'll
always
love
you
but
you're
too
hard
to
hold
just
take
my
heart
baby
just
take
my
heart
when
you
go
take
my
heart
just
take
my
heart
i
will
be
walking
one
day
down
a
street
far
away
and
see
a
face
in
the
crowd
and
smile
knowing
how
you
made
me
laugh
hearing
sweet
echoes
of
you
from
the
past
i
will
remember
you
look
in
my
eyes
while
you're
near
tell
me
what's
happening
here
see
that
i
don't
want
to
say
goodbye
our
love
is
frozen
in
time
i'll
be
your
champion
and
you
will
be
mine
i
will
remember
i
will
remember
you
later
on
when
this
fire
is
an
ember
later
on
when
the
night's
not
so
tender
given
time
though
it's
hard
to
remember
darlin'
i
will
be
holding
i'll
still
be
holding
to
you
i
will
remember
you
so
many
years
come
and
gone
and
yet
the
memory
is
strong
one
word
we
never
could
learn
goodbye
true
love
is
frozen
in
time
i'll
be
your
champion
and
you
will
be
mine
i
will
remember
you
