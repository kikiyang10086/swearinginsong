a
bit
jealous
of

you're
blind
if
you
can't
see
that
his

i'm
only
pretty
sure
that
i
can't
take
anymore
before
you
take
a
swing
i
wonder
what
are
we
fighting
for
when
i
say
out
loud
&quot;i
wanna
get
out
of
this&quot;
i
wonder
is
there
anything
i'm
gonna
miss
i
wonder
how
it's
going
to
be
when
you
don't
know
me
how's
it
going
to
be
when
you're
sure
i'm
not
there
how's
it
going
to
be
when
there's
no
one
there
to
talk
to
between
you
and
me
'cause
i
don't
care
how's
it
going
to
be
how's
it
going
to
be
where
we
used
to
laugh
there's
a
shouting
match
sharp
as
a
thumbnail
scratch
a
silence
i
can't
ignore
like
the
hammock
by
the
doorway
we
spent
time
in
swings
empty
don't
see
lightning
like
last
fall
when
it
was
always
about
to
hit
me
i
wonder
how's
it
going
to
be
when
it
goes
down
how's
it
going
to
be
when
you're
not
around
how's
it
going
to
be
when
you
found
out
there
was
nothing
between
you
and
me
'cause
i
don't
care
how's
it
going
to
be
how's
it
going
to
be
and
how's
it
going
to
be
when
you
don't
know
me
anymore
and
how's
it
going
to
be
wanna
get
myself
back
in
again
the
soft
dive
of
oblivion
i
wanna
taste
the
salt
of
your
skin
the
soft
dive
of
oblivion
oblivion
how's
it
going
to
be
when
you
don't
know
me
anymore
how's
it
going
to
be
how's
it
going
to
be
every
night
in
my
dreams
i
see
you
i
feel
you
that
is
how
i
know
you

on
far
across
the
distance

come
to
show
you
go

when
i
loved
you
one
true
time
i
hold
to
in
my
life
we'll
always
go
on

i
wanted
to
send
it
back
but
something
that
i
was
feeling
said
open

that
this
letter
finds
you
in
time
cos
your

beginning
with
a
woman
that
i
know
you
hold
dear
to
you&quot;

made
me
wanna
say
i
don't
ever
wanna
see
you
again
i
don't
i
don't
but
i
stuck
by
you
till
the
end
and
my
conscience
is
clear
and
i
can
move
on
from
here
but
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
for
you
baby

it
have
to
be
my
best
friend

it
have
to
be
that
you
were
messing
round
with
i
didn't
wanna
notice
it
i
was
true
to
my
love
for
you-ou
it
took
me
a
minute
to
wake
up
and
see
what
the
love
of
my
life
was
doing
to
me
i
wanted
to
lay
down
and
die
cos
my
pride
wouldn't
let
me
cry
some
how
i
knew
i
had
to
get
over
it
he
said

felt
your
touch
now
he
can
see
why
i
love
you
so
much
and

ever
what
you

semi-charmed
kind
of

the
sky
was
gold
it
was
rose
i
was
taking
sips
up
into
my
nose
and
i
wish
i
could
get
back
there
some
place
back
there
smiling
in
the
pictures
you
would
take
doing
crystal
meth
will
lift
you
up
until
you
break
it
won't
stop
i
won't
come
down
i
keep
stock
with
a
tick-tock
rhythm
a
bump
for
the
drop
and
then
i
bumped
up
i
took
the
hit
that
i
was
given
then
i
bumped
again
then
i
bumped
again
i
said
how
do
i
get
back
there
to
the
place
where
i
fell
asleep
inside
you
how
do
i
get
myself
back
to
the
place
where
you
said
i
want
something
else
to
get
me
through
this
semi-charmed
kind
of
life
baby
baby
i
want
something
else
i'm
not
listening
when
you
say
goodbye
i
believe
in
the
sand
beneath
my
toes
the
beach
gives
a
feeling
an
earthy
feeling
i
believe
in
the
faith
that
grows
and
the
four
right
chords
can
make
me
cry
when
i'm
with
you
i
feel
like
i
could
die
and
that
would
be
alright
alright
and
when
the
plane
came
in
she
said
she
was
crashing
the
velvet
it
rips
in
the
city
we
tripped
on
the
urge
to
feel
alive
but
now
i'm
struggling
to
survive
those
days
you
were
wearing
that
velvet
dress
you're
the
priestess
i
must
confess
those
little
red
panties
they
pass
the
test
so
slide
up
'round
the
belly
face
down
on
the
mattress
one
and
you
hold
me
and
we
are
broken
still
it's
all
that
i
want
to
do
just
a
little
now
feel
myself
hovering
off
the
ground
i'm
scared
i'm
not
coming
down
no
no
and
i
won't
run
for
my
life
she's
got
her
jaws
now
locked
down
in
a
smile
but
nothing
is
alright
alright
and
i
want
something
else
to
get
me
through
this
life
baby
i
want
something
else
not
listening
when
you
say
goodbye
goodbye

with
you.

with
crying

i'm
done
with
you.
when
i
feel
so
tired
then
i'm
done
with
you.
everybody
feels
this
way
sometimes
everybody
feels
this
way

i
do.
you
can't

i
do.
you
can't
hear
it
but
i
do.
you're
trying
to
convince
me
that
what
i've
done's
not
right.
i
get
so
frustrated
i
stay
up
every
night.
you
ask
me
for
an
answer
and
i'm
so
tired
and
i'm
up
in
the
air.
i'm
up
in
the
air.
everybody
feels

sometimes
everybody
feels
this

and
i
do.
you
can't
hear
it
but
i
do.
you
can't
hear
it
but
i'm
feeling
this
way
just
because
you
say
i
will
be
ignored.
i
will
be
denied.
and
i
could
be
erased.
i
could
be
brushed
aside.
i
will
get
scared
i
will
get
shoved
down
but
i
feel
like
i
do
because
you
push
me
around.
i'm
starting
to
ignore
you
i've
doubted
you
so
long.
i'm
tired
of
over-thinking
i
know
you
don't
belong.
now
i'm
asking
questions
-
no
one
pushes
me
around.
everybody
feels
this
way
sometimes
everybody
feels
this
way
-
and
i
do.
you
can't
hear
it
but
i
do.
you
don't
seem
angry
but
i
do.
i
do.
i
do.
i

you
don't

you
don't
hear
it
but
i
do.
look
at
the
sky
tell
me
what
do
you
see
just
close
your
eyes
and
describe
it
to
me
the
heavens
are
sparkling
with
starlight
tonight
that's
what
i
see
through
your
eyes
i
see
the
heavens
each
time
that
you
smile
i
hear
your
heartbeat
just
go
on
for
miles
and
suddenly
i
know
my
life
is
worth
while
that's
what
i
see
through
your
eyes
[chorus:]
here
in
the
night
i
see
the
sun
here
in
the
dark
our
two
hearts
are
one
it's
out
of
our
hands
we
can't
stop
what
we
have
begun
and
love
just
took
me
by
surprise
looking
through
your
eyes
i
look
at
myself
and
instead
i
see
us
whoever
i
am
now
it
feels
like
enough
and
i
see
a
girl
who
is
learning
to
trust
that's
who
i
see
through
your
eyes
[chorus]
and
there
are
some
things
we
don't
know
sometimes
a
heart
just
needs
to
go

when
the
ash

the
birch
and
yew
are
dressed
in
ribbons
fair
when
owls
call
the
breathless
moon
in
the
blue
veil
of
the
night
the
shadows
of
the

gay

will
go
down
to
those
shady
groves
and
summon
the
shadows
there
and
tie
a
ribbon
on
those
sheltering
arms
in
the
springtime
of
the
year
the
songs
of
birds
seem
to
fill
the
wood
that
when
the
fiddler
plays
all
their
voices
can
be
heard

we
bring

and
so
they
linked
their
hands
and
danced
round
in
circles
and
in
rows
and
so
the
journey
of
the
night
descends
when
all
the
shades
are
gone
&quot;a

bring
you

at

i
never
planned
to
be
your
man

down
my
heart
got
broken
oh
it
hurt
so
bad
i'm
sad
to
say
love
wins
again
so
i
placed
my
heart
under
lock
and
key
to
take
some
time
and
take
care
of
me
but
i
turn
around
and
you're
standing
here
[chorus]
this
time
i
swear
i'm
through
but
if
only
you
knew
how
many
times
i've
said
those
words
then
fall
again
when
will
i
ever
learn
knowing
these
tears
i
cry
this
lovely
black
butterfly
must
take
a
chance
and
spread
my
wings
love
can
make
you
do
some
crazy
things
so
i
placed
my
heart
under
lock
and
key
to
take
some
time
and
take
care
of
me
but
i
turn
around
and
you're
standing
here
[repeat
chorus
to
fade]
