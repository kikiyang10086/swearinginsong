moves
faster

you
i
gave
you
my

i
showed

your
lies

you
weren't
worth

be

roller-coasting

we've
been
here
before
surrounded
in
the
cold
you
take
me
to
places
i've
never
known
and
you
push
me
to
places
i'll
never
go
i
would
die

you
tell
me

you
would
need
if
we're
keeping
it

you're
all
that
i
need
for
me
from
the
jump
until
forever
from
now
i
would
ride
for
you


but
you
got
me
shot
down
by
love
you
got
my
heart
now
why
won't
you
stop
now
oh
i've
been
knocked
down

you
you

you
stop

been
through
it
whole
i've
been
through
the
worst
but
i
never
knew
how
much
our
love
could
hurt
over
my
family
i
put
you
first
writing
out
my
feelings
is
the
only
thing
that
work
i
don't
hear
from
the
friends
i
thought
were
mine
too
but
i
hold
on
to
the
poems
i
would
write
you
happy
seventeen
i
saw
us
two
and

hold
onto
their
secrets

torn
up

we
float
above
horizons

sail
across

i
hope
for
better
days
and
lightly
times
are
tough
the
angels
give
me
strength
and
i'm
not
giving
up
so
i
wipe
away
my
tears
i
unveil
my
pain
they're
brushing
off
my
shoulders
and
i

lyrics
are
we
better
off
believing
what
the
ignorance
suggests
i
wish
living
life
was
easy

but
mine
has
been
a
mess
they
say
it
comes
with
the
seasons

but
the
seasons
come
and
go

i
go
blurry
when
i'm
thinking
is
it
me
or
vertigo


criticized
who
am
i
to
give
up
i’m
breathing
what's
the
reason
to
let
up
sympathize
who
am
i
to
give
up
putting

my

also
like
i've
been
better
off
than
broken
i’ve
been
battered
i've
been
beat
i
wish
i
was
more
outspoken
but
the
words
are
out
of
reach
hmm
thought
i
loved
you
in
the
moment
i
was
happy
i
was
young
i've
been
learning
i've
been
growing
but
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
