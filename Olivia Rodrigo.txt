lyrics
i
got
my
driver's
license
last
week
just
like
we
always
talked
about
'cause
you
were
so excited for
me
to
finally drive
up
to
your
house
but
today i
drove
through
the
suburbs
crying
'cause
you
weren't
around


and
you're probably with that
blonde
girl
who always
made
me doubt
she's
so
much
older
than
me
she's
everything
i'm
insecure
about
yeah
today
i
drove
through
the
suburbs
'cause
how
could
i
ever
love
someone
else


and
i
know
we
weren't
perfect
but
i've
never
felt
this
way
for
no
one
and
i
just
can't
imagine
how
you
could
be
so
okay
now
that
i'm
gone
guess
you
didn't
mean
what
you
wrote
in
that
song
about
me
'cause
you
said
forever
now
i
drive
alone
past
your
street


and
all
my
friends
are
tired
of
hearing
how
much
i
miss
you
but
i
kinda
feel
sorry
for
them
'cause
they'll
never
know
you
the
way
that
i
do
yeah
today
i
drove
through
the
suburbs
and
pictured
i
was
driving
home
to
you
you
might
also
like
and
i
know
we
weren't
perfect

now
i
drive
alone
past
your
street


red
lights
stop
signs
i
still
see
your
face
in
the
white
cars
front
yards
can't
drive
past
the
places
we
used
to
go
to
'cause
i
still
fuckin'
love
you
babe

sidewalks
we
crossed
i
still
hear
your
voice
in
the
traffic
we're
laughing
over
all
the
noise
god
i'm
so
blue
know
we're
through
but
i
still
fuckin'
love
you
babe

told
me
i
was

he
held
the
door
held
my hand in
the
dark
and he's
perfect
on

he's lying

we
fell
in

it
didn't

'cause
the

i
figure
it

he
pushes
me
away

i
won't
fight
for
love
if
you
won't

i
have

myself
at

the

but
shouldn't
that
be
enough
for

i

the
days
when
i
was

would
come

down
show
her
off
like
she's
a

and
i
know
if
you
were
true
there's
no
damn
way
that
you
could
fall
in
love
with
somebody
that
quickly


and
ain't
it
funny
all
the
twisted
games
all
the
questions
you
used
to
avoid
ain't
it
funny
remember
i
brought
her
up
and
you
told
me
i
was
paranoid


you
betrayed
me

wore
long

fell

took
his
bad

made
a
royal

he's
mine
until
then
you're
