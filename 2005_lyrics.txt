love
yeah
i
didn't
mean
it
when
i
said
i
didn't
love
you
so
i
should've
held
on
tight
i
never
should've
let
you
go
i
didn't
know
nothing
i
was
stupid
i
was
foolish
i
was
lying
to
myself
i
couldn't
have
fathomed
i
would
ever
be
without
your
love
never
imagined
i'd
be
sitting
here
beside
myself
guess
i
didn't
know
you
guess
i
didn't
know
me
but
i
thought
i
knew
everything
i
never
felt
the
feeling
that
i'm
feeling
now
that
i
don't
hear
your
voice
or
have
your
touch
and
kiss
your
lips
'cause
i
don't
have
a
choice
oh
what
i
wouldn't
give
to
have
you
lying
by
my
side

on
me
i
know
there's
something
in
the
wake
of
your
smile.
i
get
a
notion
from
the
look
in
your
eyes
yea.
you've
built
a
love
but
that
love
falls
apart.
your
little
piece
of
heaven
turns
too
dark.
listen
to
your
heart
when
he's
calling
for
you.
listen
to
your
heart
there's
nothing
else
you
can
do.
i
don't
know
where
you're
going
and
i
don't
know
why
but
listen
to
your
heart
before
you
tell
him
goodbye.
sometimes
you
wonder
if
this
fight
is
worthwhile.
the
precious
moments
are
all
lost
in
the
tide
yea.
they're
swept
away
and
nothing
is
what
is
seems
the
feeling
of
belonging
to
your
dreams.
listen
to
your
heart
when
he's
calling
for
you.
listen
to
your
heart
there's
nothing
else
you
can
do.
i
don't
know
where
you're
going
and
i
don't
know
why
but
listen
to
your
heart
before
you
tell
him
goodbye.
and
there
are
voices
that
want
to
be
heard.
so
much
to
mention
but
you
can't
find
the
words.
the
scent
of
magic
the
beauty
that's
been
when
love
was
wilder
than
the
wind.
listen
to
your
heart
when
he's
calling
for
you.
listen
to
your
heart
there's
nothing
else
you
can
do.
i
don't
know
where
you're
going
and
i
don't
know
why
but
listen
to
your
heart
before
you
tell
him
goodbye.
listen
to
your
heart
mm-mmmmmm
i
don't
know
where
you're
going
and
i
don't
know
why
but
listen
to
your
heart
before
you
tell
him
goodbye.
i
tear
my
heart
open
i
sew
myself
shut
my
weakness

up

the
side

up

look
up
at
night.

moving
at

chance
that
you
get
is
a
chance
you
seize.
how
long
am
i
gonna
stand
with
my
head
stuck
under
the
sand
i'll
start
before
i
can
stop
but
before
i
see
things
the
right
way
up.
all
that
noise
and
all
that
sound.
all
those
places

got
found.

birds
go
flying
at
the

show
you
how
it
all
began.

came
flying
from
the
underground.

you
could
see
it
then
you'd
understand.
ideas
that
you'll
never

all
the
inventors

never
design.
the
buildings
that
you
put
up.
japan
and
china
all
lit
up.
the
sign
that
i
couldn't
read
or
a
light
that
i
couldn't
see.
some
things
you
have
to
believe
but
others
are
puzzles
puzzling
me.
all
that
noise
and
all
that
sound.
all
those
places
i
got
found.

then
you'll
understand.
all
those
signsxe2x80x94
i
knew
what
they
meant.
some
things

can
invent.

made
and

even
when
you
laugh
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
deep
inside
you
want
to
cry
'cause
you're
scared
i
ain't
there
daddy's
with
you
in
your
prayers
no
more
crying

them
tears

more
nightmares

gon'
pull
together
through
it
we

it
lainie
uncle's
crazy
ain't
he
yeah
but
he
loves
you
girl
and
you
better
know
it
we're
all
we
got
in
this
world
when
it
spins
when
it
swirls
when
it
whirls
when
it
twirls
two
little
beautiful
girls
lookin'
puzzled
in
a
daze
i
know
it's
confusing
you
daddy's
always
on
the
move
mamma's
always
on
the
news
i
try
to
keep
you
sheltered
from
it
but
somehow
it
seems
the
harder
that
i
try
to
do
that
the
more
it
backfires
on
me
all
the
things
growing
up
as
daddy
that
he
had
to
see
daddy
don't
want
you
to
see
but
you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
we
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way
your
mother
and
me
but
things
have
got
so
bad
between
us
i
don't
see
us
ever
being
together
ever
again
like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
but
then
of
course
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
i
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be
but
it's
just
something
we
have
no
control
over
and
that's
what
destiny
is
but
no
more
worries
rest
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
maybe
one
day
we'll
wake
up
and
this
will
all
just
be
a
dream
now
hush
little
baby
don't
you
cry
everything's
gonna
be
alright
stiffen
that
upper
lip
up
little
lady
i
told
ya
daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
i
know
mommy's
not
here
right
now
and
we
don't
know
why
we
fear
how
we
feel
inside
it
may
seem
a
little
crazy
pretty
baby
but
i
promise
mama's
gon'
be
alright
ha
it's
funny
i
remember
back
one
year
when
daddy
had
no
money
mommy
wrapped
the
christmas
presents
up
and
stuck
'em
under
the
tree
and
said
some
of
'em
were
from
me
'cause
daddy
couldn't
buy
'em
i'll
never
forget
that
christmas
i
sat
up
the
whole
night
crying
'cause
daddy
felt
like
a
bum
see
daddy
had
a
job
but
his
job
was
to
keep
the
food
on
the
table
for
you
and
mom
and
at
the
time
every
house
that
we
lived
in
either
kept
getting
broken
into
and
robbed
or
shot
up
on
the
block
and
your
mom
was
saving
money
for
you
in
a
jar
tryna
start
a
piggy
bank
for
you
so
you
could
go
to
college
almost
had
a
thousand
dollars
'til
someone
broke
in
and
stole
it
and
i
know
it
hurts
so
bad
it
broke
your
mamma's
heart
and
it
seemed
like
everything
was
just
startin'
to
fall
apart
mom
and
dad
was
arguin'
a
lot
so
momma
moved
back
on
the
chalmers
in
the
flat
one
bedroom
apartment
and
dad
moved
back
to
the
other
side
of
8
mile
on
novara
and
that's
when
daddy
went
to
california
with
his
cd
and
met
dr.
dre
and
flew
you
and
momma
out
to
see
me
but
daddy
had
to
work
you
and
momma
had
to
leave
me
then
you
started
seeing
daddy
on
the
t.v.
and
momma
didn't
like
it
and
you
and
lainnie
were
too
young
to
understand
it
papa
was
a
rollin'
stone
momma
developed
a
habit
and
it
all
happened
too
fast
for
either
one
of
us
to
grab
it
i'm
just
sorry
you
were
there
and
had
to
witness
it
first
hand
'cause
all
i
ever
wanted
to
do
was
just
make
you
proud
now
i'm
sitting
in
this
empty
house
just
reminiscing
lookin'
at
your
baby
pictures
it
just
trips
me
out
to
see
how
much
you
both
have
grown
it's
almost
like
you're
sisters
now
wow

much

and
daddy's
still
here

it
get
that
far
because

you
i
never
stray
too
far

learned
to
play
on
the
safe
side
so
i
don't
get
hurt
because
of
you
i
find
it
hard

only
me
but
everyone
around
me
because
of
you
i
am
afraid
i
lose
my
way
and
it's
not
too
long
before
you
point
it
out
i
cannot
cry
because
i
know
that's
weakness
in
your
eyes
i'm
forced
to
fake
a
smile
a
laugh
every
day
of
my
life
my
heart
can't
possibly
break
when
it
wasn't
even
whole
to
start
with
because
of
you
i
never
stray
too
far
from
the
sidewalk
because
of
you
i
learned
to
play
on
the
safe
side
so
i
don't
get
hurt
because
of
you
i
find
it
hard
to
trust
not
only
me
but
everyone
around
me
because
of
you
i
am
afraid
i
watched
you
die
i
heard
you
cry
every
night
in
your
sleep
i
watched
you
die
in
your
sleep
i
was
so
young
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
lean
on
me
i
was
too
young
for
you
to
lean
on
me
you
never
thought
of
anyone
else
you
just
saw
your
pain
you
never
saw
me
yeah
yeah
and
now
i
cry
in
the
middle
of
the
night
for
the
same
damn
thing
because
of
you
i
never
stray
too
far
from
the
sidewalk
because
of
you
i
learned
to
play
on
the
safe
side
so
i
don't
get
hurt
because
of
you
i
try
my
hardest
just
to
forget
everything
because
of
you
i
don't
know
how
to
let
anyone
else
in
because
of
you
i'm
ashamed
of
my
life
because
it's
empty
because
of
you
i
am
afraid
because
of
you
ah-ah

she
said
&quot;i've
seen
you
in
here
before.&quot;
i
said
&quot;i've
been
here
a
time
or
two.&quot;
she
said
&quot;hello
my
name
is
bobby
jo.
meet
my
twin
sister
betty
lou.
and
we're
both
feeling
kinda
wild
tonight.
you're
the
only
cowboy
in
this
place.
and
if
you're
up
for
a
rodeo
i'll
put
a
big
texas
smile
on
your
face.&quot;
i
said
&quot;girls
i
ain't
as
good
as
i
once
was
i
got
a
few
years
on
me
now
but
there
was
a
time
back
in
my
prime
when
i
could
really
lay
it
down.
and
if
you
need
some
love
tonight
then
i
might
have
just
enough.
i
ain't
as
good
as
i
once
was
but
i'm
as
good
once
as
i
ever
was.&quot;
i
still
hang
out
with
my
best
friend
dave.
i've
known
him
since
we
were
kids
at
school.
last
night
he
had
a
few
shots
got
in
a
tight
spot
hustlin'
a
game
of
pool
with
a
couple
of
redneck
boys.
one
great
big
bad
biker
man.
i
heard
david
yell
across
the
room
&quot;hey
buddy
how
'bout
a
helping
hand&quot;
i
said
&quot;dave
i
ain't
as
good
as
i
once
was.
my
how
the
years
have
flown
but
there
was
a
time
back
in
my
prime
when
i
could
really
hold
my
own.
but
if
you
wanna
fight
tonight
guess
those
boys
don't
look
all
that
tough.
i
ain't
as
good
as
i
once
was
but
i'm
as
good
once
as
i
ever
was.&quot;
i
used
to
be
hell
on
wheels
back
when
i
was
a
younger
man.
now
my
body
says
&quot;you
can't
do
this
boy&quot;
but
my
pride
says
&quot;oh
yes
you
can.&quot;
i
ain't
as
good
as
i
once
was.
that's
just
the
cold
hard
truth.
i
still
throw
a
few
back
talk
a
little
smack
when
i'm
feeling
bullet-proof.
so
don't
double-dog
dare
me
now
'cause
i'd
have
to
call
your
bluff.
i
ain't
as
good
as
i
once
was
but
i'm
as
good
once
as
i
ever
was.
may
not
be
good
as
i
once
was
but
i'm
as
good
once
as
i
ever
was.

girl
i'm
in
love
with
you
this
ain't
the
honeymoon
past
the
infatuation
phase
right
in
the
thick
of
love
at
times
we
get
sick
of
love
it
seems
like
we
argue
everyday
i
know
i
misbehaved
and
you
made
your
mistakes
and
we
both
still
got
room
left
to
grow
and
though
love
sometimes
hurts
i
still
put
you
first
and
we'll
make
this
thing
work
but
i
think
we
should
take
it
slow
we're
just
ordinary
people
we
don't
know
which
way
to
go
'cause
we're
ordinary
people
maybe
we
should
take
it
slow
take
it
slow
this
time
we'll
take
it
slow
take
it
slow
this
time
we'll
take
it
slow
this
ain't
a
movie
no
no
fairy
tale
conclusion
yall
it
gets
more
confusing
everyday
sometimes
it's
heaven
sent
then
we
head
back
to
hell
again
we
kiss
then
we
make
up
on
the
way
i
hang
up
you
call
we
rise
and
we
fall
and
we
feel
like
just
walking
away
but
as
our
love
advances
we
take
second
chances
though
it's
not
a
fantasy
i
still
want
you
to
stay
we're
just
ordinary
