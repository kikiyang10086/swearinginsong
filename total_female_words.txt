lyrics
i
walked
through
the
door
with
you
the
air
was
cold
but
somethin'
'bout
it
felt
like
home
somehow
and
i
left
my
scarf
there
at
your
sister's
house
and
you've
still
got
it
in
your
drawer
even
now


oh
your
sweet
disposition
and
my
wide-eyed
gaze
we're
singin'
in
the
car
getting
lost
upstate
autumn
leaves
fallin'
down
like
pieces
into
place
and
i
can
picture
it
after
all
these
days


and
i
know
it's
long
gone
and
that
magic's
not
here
no
more
and
i
might
be
okay
but
i'm
not
fine
at
all
oh
oh
oh


'causе
there
we
arе
again
on
that
little
town
street
you
almost
ran
the
red
'cause
you
were
lookin'
over
at
me
wind
in
my
hair
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well


photo
album
on
the
counter
your
cheeks
were
turnin'
red
you
used
to
be
a
little
kid
with
glasses
in
a
twin-sized
bed
and
your
mother's
tellin'
stories
'bout
you
on
the
tee-ball
team
you
taught
me
'bout
your
past
thinkin'
your
future
was
me
and
you
were
tossing
me
the
car
keys
"fuck
the
patriarchy"
keychain
on
the
ground
we
were
always
skippin'
town
and
i
was
thinkin'
on
the
drive
down
"any
time
now
he's
gonna
say
it's
love"
you
never
called
it
what
it
was
'til
we
were
dead
and
gone
and
buried
check
the
pulse
and
come
back
swearin'
it's
the
same
after
three
months
in
the
grave
and
then
you
wondered
where
it
went
to
as
i
reached
for
you
but
all
i
felt
was
shame
and
you
held
my
lifeless
frame
see

as
low
as

might
also
like
and
i
know
it's
long
gone
and
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
and
i
forget
about
you
long
enough
to
forget
why
i
needed
to


'cause
there
we
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we're
dancin'
'round
the
kitchen
in
the
refrigerator
light
down
the
stairs
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
and
there
we
are
again
when
nobody
had
to
know
you
kept
me
like
a
secret
but
i
kept
you
like
an
oath
sacred
prayer
and
we'd
swear
to
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah


well
maybe
we
got
lost
in
translation
maybe
i
asked
for
too
much
but
maybe
this
thing
was
a
masterpiece
'til
you
tore
it
all
up
runnin'
scared
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
and
you
call
me
up
again
just
to
break
me
like
a
promise
so
casually
cruel
in
the
name
of
bein'
honest
i'm
a
crumpled-up
piece
of
paper
lyin'
here
'cause
i
remember
it
all
all
all

they
say
all's
well
that
ends
well
but
i'm
in
a
new
hell
every
time
you
double-cross
my
mind
you
said
if
we
had
been
closer
in
age
maybe
it
would've
been
fine
and
that
made
me
want
to
die
the
idea
you
had
of
me
who
was
she
a
never-needy
ever-lovely
jewel
whose
shine
reflects
on
you
not
weepin'
in
a
party
bathroom
some
actress
askin'
me
what
happened
you
that's
what
happened
you
you
who
charmed
my
dad
with
self-effacing
jokes
sippin'
coffee
like
you're
on
a
late-night
show
but
then
he
watched
me
watch
the
front
door
all
night
willin'
you
to
come
and
he
said
"it's
supposed
to
be
fun
turning
twenty-one"


time
won't
fly
it's
like
i'm
paralyzed
by
it
i'd
like
to
be
my
old
self
again
but
i'm
still
tryin'
to
find
it
after
plaid
shirt
days
and
nights
when
you
made
me
your
own
now
you
mail
back
my
things
and
i
walk
home
alone
but
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
that
very
first
week
'cause
it
reminds
you
of
innocence
and
it
smells
like
me
you
can't
get
rid
of
it
'cause
you
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah


'cause
there
we
are
again
when
i
loved
you
so
back
before
you
lost
the
one
real

"i'll

it's
made
for
me"
how
evergreen
our
group
of
friends
don't
think
we'll
say
that
word
again
and
soon
they'll
have
the
nerve
to
deck
the
halls
that
we
once
walked
through
one
for
the
money
two
for
the
show
i
never
was
ready
so
i
watch
you
go
sometimes
you
just
don't
know
the
answer
'til
someone's
on
their
knees
and
asks
you
"she
would've
made
such
a
lovely
bride
what
a
shame
she's
fucked
in
the
head"
they
said
but
you'll
find
the
real
thing
instead
she'll
patch
up
your
tapestry
that
i
shred


and
hold
your
hand
while
dancing
never
leave
you
standing
crestfallen
on
the
landing
with
champagne
problems
your
mom's
ring
in
your
pocket
her
picture
in
your
wallet
you
won't
remember
all
my
champagne
problems

here's
the
thing:
you’re
in
love
with
a
version
of
a
person
that
you've
created
in
your
head
that
you
are
trying
to
but
cannot
fix
uh
the
only
person
you
can
fix
is
yourself
i
love
you
this
has
gone
on
way
too
long
enough
is
enough
i'm
two
blocks
away
i’m
coming
over​


painted
a
picture
i
thought
i
knew
you
well
i
got
a
habit
of
seeing
what
isn't
there
caught
in
the
moment
tangled
up
in
your
sheets
when
you
broke
my
heart
i
said
you
only
wanted
half
of
me


my
imagination's
too
creative
they
see
demon
i
see
angel
angel

angel
without
the
halo
wingless
angel


falling
falling
but
i
never
thought
you'd
leave
me
falling
falling
needed
something
to
believe

oh

you
were
the
one

it
was
all
in

work
it
out
hmm
you
might
also
like
painted
a
picture;
i
thought
i
drew
you
well
i
had
a
vision

so
typical
of
me
to
talk
about

i'm

that

we
don't
even
like
we're

wants

bring
us
down

puttin'
ideas
in
our
heads
that
corrupt
our
hearts
somehow

could
blow
my
mind
soaking
it
all
up
for

now
i
only
soak
up
wine
they
say
to
play
hard
you
work
hard
find
balance
in
the
sacrifice
and

i
don't

hope
i
learn
to
get
over
myself
stop
tryin'
to
be
somebody
else
so
we
can

found
a

let
you
win

and
when
you
said
“hi”
i
forgot
my
dang
name
set
my
heart
aflame
ev’ry
part
aflame
this
is
not
a
game…
you
might
also
like
you
strike
me
as
a
woman
who
has
never
been
satisfied
i’m
sure
i
don’t
know
what
you
mean
you
forget
yourself
you’re
like
me
i’ve
never

is
that
right
i
have
never

my
name's
angelica
schuyler
alexander
hamilton
where’s
your
fam’ly
from
unimportant
there’s
a
million
things
i
haven’t
done
just
you
wait
just
you
wait


so
so
so—
so
this
is
what
it
feels
like
to
match
wits
with
someone
at
your
level
what
the
hell
is
the
catch
it’s
the
feeling
of
freedom
of
seein’
the
light
it’s
ben
franklin
with
a
key
and
a
kite
you
see
it
right
the
conversation
lasted
two
minutes
maybe
three
minutes
ev’rything
we
said
in
total
agreement
it’s
a
dream
and
it’s
a
bit
of
a
dance
a
bit
of
a
posture
it’s
a
bit
of
a
stance
he’s
a
bit
of
a
flirt
but
i’m
‘a
give
him
a
chance
i
asked
about
his
fam’ly
did
you
see
his
answer
his
hands
started
fidgeting
he
looked
askance
he’s
penniless
he’s
flying
by
the
seat
of
his
pants

handsome
boy
does
he
know
it
peach
fuzz
and
he
can’t
even
grow
it
i
wanna
take
him
far
away
from
this
place
then
i
turn
and
see
my
sister’s
face
and
she
is


helpless
and
i
know
she
is
helpless
and
her
eyes
are
just
helpless
and
i
realize
three
fundamental
truths
at
the
exact
same
time


i’m
a
girl
in
a
world
in
which
my
only
job
is
to
marry
rich
my
father
has
no
sons
so
i’m
the
one
who
has
to
social
climb
for
one
cause
i’m
the
oldest
and
the
wittiest
and
the
gossip
in
new
york
city
is
insidious
and
alexander
is
penniless
ha
that
doesn’t
mean
i
want
him
any
less




he’s
after
me
'cause
i’m
a
schuyler
sister
and
that
elevates
his
status
i’d
have
to
be
naïve
to
set
that
aside
maybe
that
is
why
i
introduce
him
to
eliza
now
that’s
his
bride
nice
going
angelica
he
was
right
you
will
never
be
satisfied





i
know
my
sister
like
i
know
my
own
mind
you
will
never
find
anyone
as
trusting
or
as
kind
if
i
tell
her
that
i
love
him
she’d
be
silently
resigned
he’d
be
mine
she
would
say
“i’m
fine”
but
she’d
be
lying

but
when
i
fantasize
at
night
it’s
alexander’s
eyes
as
i
romanticize
what
might
have
been
if
i
hadn’t
sized
him
up
so
quickly
at
least
my
dear
eliza’s
his
wife
at
least
i
keep
his
eyes
in
my
life…


to
the
groom

to
the
bride

from
your
sister

who
is
always
by
your
side

to
your
union
and
the
hope
that
you
provide


may
you
always
be
satisfied
and
i
know

she’ll
be
happy
as
his
bride
and
i
know
he
will
never
be

i
slashed
your

it's
like
we
burn
so
bright
we
burn
out
i
made
you
chase
me
i
wasn't
that
friendly
my
love
my
drug
we're
fucked
up
oh


'cause
i've
been
on
the
run
so
long
they
can't
find
me
you're
waking
up
to
remember
i'm
pretty
and
when
the
chemicals
leave
my
body
yeah
they're
gonna
find
me
in
a
hotel
lobby
'cause
mmm
tough
times
they
keep
comin'
all
night
laughin'
and
fuckin'
some
days
like
i'm
barely
breathin'
after
we
were
high
and
the
love
dope
died
it
was
you


the
pill
i
keep
takin'
the
nightmare
i
wake
in
there's
nothin'
no
nothin'
nothin'
but
you
my
perfect
rock
bottom
my

up


you
punched
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
i
framed
it
i
wish
i
could
feel
things
like
you
everyone's
chasing
that
holy
feeling
and
if
we
don't
stay
lit
we'll
blow
out
blow
out


'cause
we've
been
on
the

so
long
they
can't
find
us
who's
gonna
have
to
die
to
remind
us
that
it
feels
like
we
chose
this
blindly
now
i'm
gonna
fuck
up
a
hotel
lobby
'cause
these
tough
times
they
keep
comin'

i
might
have
messed

you
feel
when
you

do
you
pray
for
at

she's
everything
i'm
insecure
about

today
i

i
guess
you
moved
on
really
easily
you
found
a
new
girl
and
it
only
took
a
couple
weeks
remember
when
you
said
that
you
wanted
to
give
me
the
world

and
good
for
you
i
guess
that
you've
been
workin'
on
yourself
i
guess
that
therapist
i
found
for
you
she
really
helped
now
you
can
be
a
better
man

she

lyrics
i
found
a
guy
told
me
i
was
a
star
he
held
the
door
held
my hand in
the
dark
and he's
perfect
on
paper

he's lying
to
my

does
he
think
that
i'm
the
kinda
girl
who
needs
to
be
saved


and
there's
one
more
boy
he's
from
my
past
we
fell
in
love
but
it
didn't
last
'cause
the
second
i
figure
it
out
he
pushes
me
away
and
i
won't
fight
for
love
if
you
won't
meet
me
halfway
and
i
say
that
i'm
through
but
this
song's
still
for
you


all
i
want
is
love
that
lasts
is

i
want
too
much
to
ask
is
it
something
wrong

i

is
a
good
guy
are
my

far
too
high

but
what
can
i
say
all
i
have
is
myself
at
the
end
of
the
day
but
shouldn't
that
be
enough
for
me


ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh
and
i
miss
the
days
when
i
was
young
and
naive
i
thought
the
perfect
guy
would
come
and
find
me
now
happy
ever
after
it
don't
come
so
easily
you
might

i
knew
a
boy
once
when
i
was
small
a
towhead
blond
with
eyes
of
salt
he
played
the
drum
in
the
marching
band
his
parents
cared
more
about
the
bible
than
being
good
to
their
own
child
he
wore
long
sleeves
'cause
of
his
dad
and
somehow
we
fell
out
of
touch
hope
he
took
his
bad
deal
and
made
a
royal
flush
don't
know
if
i'll
see
you
again
someday
but
if
you're
out
there
i
hope
that
you're
okay


my
middle

grew
up
alone
she
raised
her

hated
who
shе
loved
she
couldn't
wait
to
go
to
college
she
was
tired
'cause
she
was
brought
into
a
world
where
family
was
merely
blood
does
she
know
how
proud
i
am
she
was
created
with
the
courage
to
unlearn
all
of
their
hatred
we
don't
talk
much
but
i
just
gotta
say
i
miss
you
and
i
hope
that
you're
okay

man
i
know
you’ll
stay
up
late
just
waitin’
for
me
you
held
me
so
tight
now
someone
else
can
but
you
were
the
first
man
that
really
loved
me


now
you're
driving
to
the
airport
not

anymore
i’ve
got
eight

his
family

just
like
you
and
mom

he

the
one
oh


i

on
my
heart
that
he's
a
good
man
i
promise
he
loves
me
he’d
never
hurt
me
you
held
me
so
tight
now
someone
else
can
but
you
were
the
first
man
that
really
loved
me
now
you're
on
the
driveway
faking
a
smile
you
wish
you
could
tell
him
he
doesn't
deserve
me
so
i
had
to
stop
the
car
and
turn
around
to
tell
you
you
were
the
first
man
that
really
loved
me


ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah


and
before
they
open
up
the
doors
i
say
"i've
never
seen
you
cry
before"
you
say
"you've
never
looked
so
beautiful
you
know
you'll
always
be
my
little
girl"

you're
looking
at
me
while
walking
down
the
aisle
with
tears
in
your
eyes
maybe
he
deserves
me
you
don't
even
know
how
much
it
means
to
me
now
that
you
were
the
first
man
that
really
loved
me
oh
really
loved
me
oh
you

i
can
just
hear
them
now
"how
could
you
let
us
down"
but
they
don't
know
what
i
found
or
see
it
from
this
way
around
feeling
it
overtake
all
that
i
used
to
hate
worried
'bout
every
trait
i
tried
but
it's
way
too
late
all
the
signs
i
don't
read
two
sides
of
me
can't
agree
when
i
breathe
in
too
deep
going
with
what
i
always
longed
for


feel
like
a
brand
new
person

well
i
don’t
care
i’m
in
love

feel
like
a
brand
new
person

i
finally
know
what
it's
like




and
i
still
don’t
know
why
it’s
happening

and
i
still
don’t
know
you
might
also
like
finally
taking
flight
i
know
you
don't
think
it's
right
i
know
that
you
think
it's
fake
maybe
fake's
what
i
like
point
is
i
have
the
right
not
thinking
in
black
and
white
i'm
thinking
it's
worth
the
fight
soon
to
be
out
of
sight
knowing
it
all
this
time
going
with
what
i
always

how

i
know
that
it's
right




and
i
know
that
it's
hard
to
digest
but
maybe
your
story
ain’t
so
different
from
the
rest
and
i
know
it
seems
wrong
to
accept
but
you've
got
your
demons
and
she's
got
her
regrets
and
i
know
that
it's
hard
to
digest
a
realization
is
as
good
as
it
gets
and
i
know
it
seems
wrong

lyrics
on
the
first
page
of
our
story
the
future
seemed
so
bright
then
this
thing
turned
out
so
evil
i
don't
know
why
i'm
still
surprised
even
angels
have
their
wicked
schemes
and
you
take
that
to
new
extremes
but
you'll
always
be
my
hero
even
though
you've
lost
your
mind


just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
well
that's
alright
because
i
like
the
way
it
hurts
just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
well
that's
alright
because
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i
love
the
way
you
lie
oh
i
love
the
way
you
lie


now
there's
gravel
in
our
voices
glass
is
shattered
from
the
fight
in
this
tug
of
war
you'll
always
win
even
when
i'm
right
'cause
you
feed
me
fables
from
your
head
with
violent
words
and
empty
threats
and
it's
sick
that
all
these
battles
are
what
keeps
me
satisfied
you
might
also
like
just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
well
that's
alright
because
i
like
the
way
it
hurts
just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
well
that's
alright
because
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i
love
the
way
you
lie
oh
i
love
the
way
you
lie
oh


so
maybe
i'm
a
masochist
i
try
to
run
but
i
don't
wanna
ever
leave
'til
the
walls
are
going
up
in
smoke
with
all
our
memories


it's
morning
you
wake
a
sunray
hits
your
face
smeared
makeup
as
we
lay
in
the
wake
of
destruction

hush
baby
speak
softly
tell
me
you're
awfully
sorry
that
you
pushed
me
into
the
coffee
table
last
night
so
i
can
push
you
off
me
try
and
touch
me
so
i
can
scream
at
you
not
to
touch
me
run
out
the
room
and
i'll
follow
you
like
a
lost
puppy
baby
without
you
i'm
nothing
i'm
so
lost
hug
me
then
tell
me
how
ugly
i
am
but
that
you'll
always
love
me
then
after
that
shove
me
in
the
aftermath
of
the
destructive
path
that
we're
on
two
psychopaths
but
we
know
that
no
matter
how
many
knives
we
put
in
each
other's
backs
that
we'll
have
each
other's
backs
'cause
we're
that
lucky
together
we
move
mountains
let's
not
make
mountains
out
of
molehills
you
hit
me
twice
yeah
but
who's
counting
i
may
have
hit
you
three
times
i'm
starting
to
lose
count
but
together
we'll
live
forever
we
found
the
youth
fountain
our
love
is
crazy
we're
nuts
but
i
refused
counseling
this
house
is
too
huge
if
you
move
out
i'll
burn
all
two
thousand
square
feet
of
it
to
the
ground
ain't
shit
you
can
do
about
it
'cause
with
you
i'm
in
my

without
you
i'm
out
it

just
gonna
stand
there

watch
me
burn
well

alright

i
like
the
way

hurts

sour
apple

you
taste
so
sweet
you
got
hips like jagger

two left

you'd like

your

is
velvet
through
a
telephone
you
can
come
to
mine

both
my
roommates
are
home
think
i
know
a
bar
where
they
would
leave
us
alone
and
i
wonder
if
you'd
take
it
slow


oh
we're
dancin'
in
my
living
room
and
up
come
my
fists
and
i
say
i'm
only
playing
but
the
truth
is
this
that
i've
never
seen
a
mouth
that
i
would
kill
to
kiss
and
i'm
terrified

i

grab
your

and
then
we
run
to
the
car
singing
in
the
street
and
playing
air
guitar
stuck
between
my
teeth
just
like
a
candy

i
wonder

it
goes

far
to

i've
never

a

face
you
stopped
me
in
my
tracks

put
me
right
in
my
place
used
to

loving
meant
a
painful
chase

you're
right
