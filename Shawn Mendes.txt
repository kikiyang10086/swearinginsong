i
know
a
girl
she's
like
a
curse
we
want
each
other
no
one
will
break
first
so
many
nights
trying
to
find
someone
new
they
don't
mean
nothing
compared
to
her
and
i
know


when
people
ask
about
us
now
we
just
brush
it
off
i
don't
know
why
we
act
like
it
means
nothing
at
all
i
wish
that
i
could
tell
you
that
you're
all
that
i
want
yeah

hear
you
sing
it
gets
hard

can't

think
every
song's
about
me
and
every
line
every
word
that
i
write
you
are
the
muse
in
the
back
of
my
mind
oh


don't
wanna
ask
about
it
'cause
you
might
