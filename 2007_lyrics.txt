i
never

it's
been
some
time
since
we
last
spoke
this
is
gonna
sound
like
a
bad
joke
but
momma
i
fell
in
love
again
it's
safe
to
say
i
have
a
new
girlfriend
and
i
know
it
sounds
so
old
but
cupid
got
me
in
a
chokehold
and
i'm
afraid
i
might
give
in
towels
on
the
mat
my
white
flag
is
wavin'
i
mean
she
even
cooks
me
pancakes
and
alka
seltzer
when
my
tummy
aches
if
that
ain't
love
then
i
don't
know
what
love
is
we
even
got
a
secret
handshake
and
she
loves
the
music
that
my
band
makes
i
know
i'm
young
but
if
i
had
to
choose
her
or
the
sun
i'd
be
one
nocturnal
son
of
a
gun
take
a
look
at
my
girlfriend
she's
the

i

it's
been
awhile
since
we
talked
last
and
i'm
tryin'
hard
not
to
talk
fast
but
dad
i'm
finally
thinkin'
i
may
have
found
the
one
type
of
girl
that'll
make
you
way
proud
of
your
son
and
i
know
you
heard
the
last
song
about
the
girls
that
didn't
last
long
but
i
promise
this
is
on
a
whole
new
plane
i
can
tell
by
the
way
she
says
my
name
i
love
it
when
she
calls
my
phone
she
even
got
her
very
own
ringtone
if
that
ain't
love
then
i
don't
know
what
love
is
it's
gonna
be
a
long
drive
home
but
i
know
as
soon
as
i
arrive
home
and
i
open
the
door
take
off
my
coat
and
throw
my
bag
on
the
floor
she'll
be
back
into
my
arms
once
more
for
sure
like
take
a
look
at
my
girlfriend
she's
the
only
one
i
got
not
much
of
a
girlfriend
i
never
seem
to
get
a
lot
she's
got
a
smile
that
would
make
the
most
senile
annoying
old
man
bite
his
tongue
i'm
not
done
she's
got
eyes
comparable
to
sunrise
and
it
doesn't
stop
there
man
i
swear
she's
got
porcelain
skin
of
course
she's
a
ten
and
now
she's
even
got
her
own
song
but
movin'
on
she's
got
the
cutest
laugh
i
ever
heard
and
we
can
be
on
the
phone
for
three
hours
not
sayin'
one
word
and
i
would
still
cherish
every
moment
and
when
i
start
to
build
my
future
she's
the
main
component
call
it
dumb
call
it
luck
call
it
love
or
whatever
you
call
it
but
everywhere
i
go
i
keep
her
picture
in
my
wallet
like
here
take
a
look
at
my

she's

staring
out
into
the
night
trying
to
hide
the
pain
i'm
going
to
the
place
where
love
and
feeling
good
don't
ever
cost
a
thing
and
the
pain
you
feel's
a
different
kind
of
pain
well
i'm
going
home
to
the
place
where
i
belong
and
where
your
love
has
always
been
enough
for
me
i'm
not
running
from
no

got
me
all
wrong

don't
regret
this
life
i
chose
for
me
but
these
places
and
these
faces
are
getting

i'm
going
home
well

not
always
been
the
best
man

friend
for
you

your
love
remains
true
and
i
don't
know
why
you
always
seem
to
give
me
another
try
so
i'm
going
home

now
i'm
missing
you
and
i'm
wishing
you
would
come
back
through
my
door.
why
did
you
have
to
go
you
could
have
let
me
know.
so
now
i'm
all
alone.
girl
you
could
have
stayed
but
you
wouldn't
give
me
a
chance.
with
you
not
around
it's
a
little
bit
more
than
i
can
stand.
and
all
my
tearsxe2x80x94they
keep
running
down
my
face.
why
did
you
turn
away
so
why
does
your
pride
make
you
run
and
hide
are
you
that
afraid
of
me
but
i
know
it's
a
lie
what
you
keep
inside.
this
is
not
how
you
want
it
to
be.
so
baby
i
will
wait
for
you
'cause
i
don't
know
what
else
i
can
do.
don't
tell
me
i
ran
out
of
time.
if
it
takes
the
rest
of
my
life
baby
i
will
wait
for
you.
if
you
think
i'm
fine
it
just
ain't
true.
i
really
need
you
in
my
life.
no
matter
what
i
have
to
do
i'll
wait
for
you.
been
a
long
time
since
you
called
me.
how
could
you
forget
about
me
you
gotta
be
feeling
crazy
crazy.
how
can
you
walk
away
everything
stays
the
same
the
same.
i
just
can't
do
it
baby.
what
will
it
take
to
make
you
come
back
girl
i
told
you
what
it
is
and
it
just
ain't
like
that.
no.
why
can't
you
look
at
me
you're
still
in
love
with
me.
don't
leave
me
crying.
baby
why
can't
we
just
just
start
over
again
get
it
back
to
the
way
it
was
if
you
give
me
a
chance
i
can
love
you
right
but
you're
telling
me
it
won't
be
enough.
so
baby
i
will
wait
for
you
'cause
i
don't
know
what
else
i
can
do.
don't
tell
me
i
ran
out
of
time.
if
it
takes
the
rest
of
my
life
baby
i
will
wait
for
you.
if
you
think
i'm
fine
it
just
ain't
true.
i
really
need
you
in
my
life.
no
matter
what
i
have
to
do
i'll
wait
for
you.
so
why
does
your
pride
make
you
run
and
hide
are
you
that
afraid
of
me
but
i
know
it's
a
lie
what
you're
keeping
inside.
that
is
not
how
you
want
it
to
be.
baby
i
will
wait
for
you.
baby
i
will
wait
for
you
if
it's
the
last
thing
i
do.
baby
i
will
wait
for
you
'cause
i
don't
know
what

i
can
do.
don't
tell

i
ran

if
it
takes
the

baby
i
will

we're
all
misunderstood
they
say
we
stand
for
nothing

there's
no
way
we
ever
could
now
we
see
everything
that's
going
wrong
with
the
world
and
those
who
lead
it
we
just
feel
like
we
don't
have
the
means
to
rise
above
and

it
so

we
keep
on
waiting
waiting
waiting

it's
hard
to
beat
the
system
when
we're
standing
at
a
distance
so
we
keep
waiting
waiting
waiting
on
the
world
to
change
now
if
we
had
the
power
to
bring
our
neighbors
home
from
war
they
would
have
never
missed
a
christmas
no
more
ribbons
on
their
door
and
when
you
trust
your
television
what
you
get
is
what
you
got
cause
when
they
own
the
information
oh
they
can
bend
it
all
they
want
that's
why
we're
waiting
waiting
waiting
on
the
world
to
change
we
keep
on
waiting
waiting
waiting
on
the
world
to
change
it's
not
that
we
don't
care
we
just
know
that
the
fight
ain't
fair
so
we
keep
on
waiting
waiting
waiting
on
the
world
to
change
and
we're
still
waiting
waiting
waiting
on
the

we
keep

waiting
waiting
waiting

our

we'll
never

peace
drew
looks
at

i
fake
a

so
he
won't
see
that
i
want
and
i'm
needing
everything
that
we
should
be
i'll
bet
she's
beautiful
that
girl
he
talks
about
and
she's
got
everything
that
i
have
to
live
without
drew
talks
to
me
i
laugh

it's
just
so
funny
that
i
can't
even
see
anyone
when
he's
with

he
says
he's
so
in
love
he's
finally
got
it
right
i
wonder
if
he
knows
he's
all
i
think
about
at
night
he's
the
reason
for
the
teardrops
on
my
guitar
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
wishing
on
a
wishing
star
he's
the
song
in
the
car
i
keep
singing.
don't
know
why
i
do
drew
walks
by
me
can
he
tell
that
i
can't
breathe
and
there
he
goes
so
perfectly
the
kind
of
flawless
i
wish
i
could
be
she'd
better
hold
him
tight
give
him
all
her
love
look
in

the

your
nightgown
used
to
be

told
myself

won't

better
than

looking
through
your
old
box
of
notes

found
those
pictures
i
took
that
you
were
looking
for
if
there's
one
memory
i
don't
want
to
lose
that

over
and
i
can't
pretend...
i
won't
think
about
you
when
i'm
older
cause
we
never
really
had
our
closure
this
can't
be
the
end

nervously
to

it
was
cooling
me
but
so
far
has
not
been
good
itxe2x80x99s
been
shitty
and
i
feel
awkward
as
i
should
this
club
has
got
to
be
the
most
pretentious
thing
since
i
thought
you
and
me
well
i
am
imagining
a
dark
lit
place
or
your
place
or
my
place
well
ixe2x80x99m
not
paralyzed
but
i
seem
to
be
struck
by
you
i
want
to
make
you
move

right

me
on
my

hold
out
for
one
more
drink
before
i
think
ixe2x80x99m
looking
too
desperately
but
so
far
has
not
been
fun
i
should
just
stay
home
if
one
thing
really
means
one
this
club
will
hopefully
be
closed
in
three
weeks
that
would
be
cool
with
me
