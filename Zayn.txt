don't
break

falling
i'm
for
you
i
can't

it's
a
gamble
to
take
any
more
of
you

still
in
my
mind
sometimes
i
must
admit
it
like
it's
a
crime
on
trial
i
got
acquitted
me
and
you
wasn't
meant

lyrics
i
think
we
met
and
the
time
flies
i
took
your
digits
a
while
back
i
think
we
fucked
in
the
flashback
won't
leave
my
mind
kinda
sidetracked
felt
good
but
now
i
feel
bad
i
think
i
know
i
can't
take
it
back
no
there's
nothin'
i
can
say


must
be
an
addiction
i
wanted
it
all
didn't
expect
it
to
fall
must
be
an
affliction
i
wanted
to
call
but
i
didn't
call
now
it's
keepin'
me
up
night
and
day
keepin'
me
up
night
and
day
must
be
an
addiction
now
there's
nothin'
i
can
say
but


i
guess
i
want
too
much

i
just
want
love
and
lust

you
just
can't
love
enough

that's
why
i
need
a
touch
that's
why
i
need
a
touch

that's
why
i
need
a
touch

that's
why
i
need
a
touch

that's
why
i
need
a
touch

you
might
also
like
i
never
meant
to
but
i
did
though
i
gotta
keep
it
on
the
d-low
then
again
what
the
fuck
do
i
know
you're
always
on
my
mind
so
felt
good
but
now
i
feel
bad
i
think
i
know
i
can't
take
it
back
no
there's
nothin'
i
can
say


must
be
an
addiction
i
wanted
it
all
didn't
expect
it
to
fall
must
be
an
affliction
i
wanted
to
call
but
i
didn't
call
now
it's
keepin'
me
up
night
and
day
keepin'
me
up
night
and
day
must
be
an
addiction
now
there's
nothin'
i
can
say
but


i
guess
i
want
too
much

i
just
want
love
and

you
just
can't
love
enough

that's
why
i

that's
why
i
need

that's
why
i
need
a
touch

that's
why
i
need
a
touch

that's
why
i
need
a
touch


when
the
room
becomes
a
game
we
play
white
lines
they
seem
to
turn
to
snakes
i
guess
i'll
turn
you
'way
say
white
lies
to
your
face
you
know
i
know
my
place
nothin'
i
can
say
nothin'
i
can
say
nothin'
i
can
say


i
guess
i
want
too
much

i
just
want
love
and
lust

you
just
can't
love
enough

that's
why
i
need
a
touch
that's
why
i
need
a
touch

that's
why
i
need
a
touch

that's
why
i
need
a
touch

that's
why
i
need
a
touch
