you're
an
all-star
get
your
game
on
go
play
hey
now
you're
a
rock
star

the
show

that
glitters
is
gold
only
shooting
stars
somebody
once
asked
could
i
spare
some
change
for
gas
i
need
to
get
myself
away
from
this
place
i
said
yep
what
a
concept
i
could
use
a
little
fuel
myself
and
we
could
all
use
a
little
change
well
the
years
start
coming
and
they
don't
stop
coming
fed
to
the
rules
and
i
hit
the
ground
running
didn't
make
sense
not
to
live
for
fun
your
brain
gets
smart
but
your
head
gets
dumb
so
much
to
do
so
much
to
see
so
what's
wrong
with
taking
the
back
streets
you'll
never
know
if
you
don't
go
you'll
never
shine
if
you
don't
glow
hey
now
you're
an
all-star
get
your
game
on
go
play
hey
now
you're
a
rock
star
get
the
show
on
get
paid
and
all
that
glitters
is
gold
only
shooting
stars
break
the
mold
and
all
that
glitters
is
gold
only
shooting
stars
break
the
mold
spend
all
your
time
waiting
for
that
second
chance
for
a
break
that
would
make
it
okay
there's
always
some
reason
to
feel
not
good
enough
and
it's
hard
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
need
some
distraction
oh
beautiful
release
memory
seeps
from
my
veins
let
me
be
empty
oh
and
weightless
and
maybe
i'll
find
some
peace
tonight
in
the
arms
of
the
angel
fly
away
from
here
from
this
dark
cold
hotel
room
and
the
endlessness
that
you
fear
you
are
pulled
from
the
wreckage
of
your
silent
reverie
you're
in
the
arms
of
the
angel
may
you
find
some
comfort
here
so
tired
of
the
straight
line
and
everywhere
you
turn
there's
vultures
and
thieves
at
your
back
and
the
storm
keeps
on
twisting
you
keep
on
building
the
lie
that
you
make
up
for
all
that
you
lack
it
don't
make
no
difference
escaping
one
last
time
it's
easier
to
believe
in
this
sweet
madness
oh
this
glorious
sadness
that
brings
me
to
my
knees
in
the
arms
of
the
angel
fly
away
from
here
from
this
dark
cold
hotel
room
and
the
endlessness
that
you
fear
you
are
pulled
from
the
wreckage
of
your
silent
reverie
you're
in
the
arms
of
the
angel
may
you
find
some
comfort
here
you're
in
the
arms
of
the
angel
may
you
find
some
comfort
here

hot
one
like
seven
inches
from
the
midday

when
i

we
were
out
on
a
date
in
my
daddy's
car
we
hadn't
driven
very
far
there
in
the
road
straight
up
ahead
a
car
was
stalled
the
engine
was
dead
i
couldn't
stop
so
i
swerved
to
the
right
i'll
never
forget
the
sound
that
night
the
screaming
tires
the
busting
glass
the
painful
scream
that
i
heard
last
oh
where
oh

can
my

be
the

took
her
away

she's

my

when
i
leave
this

when
i
woke
up
the
rain
was
pouring
down
there
were
people
standing
all
around
something
warm
running
through
my
eyes
but
somehow
i
found
my
baby
that
night
i
lifted
her
head
she
looked
at
me
and
said
&quot;hold
me
darling
just
a
little
while&quot;
i
held
her
close
i
kissed
her
our
last
kiss
i
found
the
love
that
i
knew
i
would
miss
but
now
she's
gone
even
though
i
hold
her
tight
i
lost
my
love
my
life
that
night
oh
where
oh
where
can
my
baby
be
the
lord
took
her
away
from
me
she's
gone
to
heaven
so
i
got
to
be
good
so
i
can
see
my
baby
when
i
leave
this

don't
forget
about
the

it's
about
a
thing
if
you
feel
real
good
wave
your
hands
in
the
air
and
lick
two
shots
in
the
atmosphere
it's
been
three
weeks
since
you
were
looking
for
your
friend
the
one
you
let
hit
it
and
never
called
you
again
'member
when
he
told
you
he
was
'bout
the
benjamins
you
act
like
you
ain't
hear
him
then
gave
him
a
little
trim
to
begin
how
you
think
you're
really
gon'
pretend
like
you
wasn't
down
and
you
called
him
again
plus
when
you
give
it
up
so
easy
you
ain't
even
fooling
him
if
you
did
it
then
then
you'd
probably
fuck
again
talking
out
your
neck
sayin'
you're
a
christian
a
muslim
sleeping
with
the
gin
now
that
was
the
sin
that
did
jezebel
in
who
you
gon'
tell
when
the
repercussions
spin
showing
off
your
ass

you're
thinking
it's
a

me
break
it
down
for
you

when
you
really
are
a

respect

i
put
into
words
how
i
feel
my
life
was
complete
i
thought
i
was
whole.
why
do
i
feel
like
i'm
losing
control
i
never
thought
that

could
feel

this.

you
changed
my

with
just
one

than
any
diamond
or
pearl
they
broke
the
mold
when
you
came
in
this
world.
and
i'm
trying
hard
to
figure
out
just
how
i
ever
did
without.
the
warmth
of
your
smile
the
heart
of
a
child
it's
deep
inside
and
leaves
me
purified.
your
love
is

she
grew
up
with
the
children
of
the
stars
in
the
hollywood
hills
and
the
boulevards
her
parents
threw
big
parties
everyone
was
there
they
hung
out
with
folks
like
dennis
hopper
and
bob
seger
and
sonny
and
cher
she
feels
safe
now
in
this
bar
on
fairfax
and
from
the
stage
i
can
tell
that
she
can't
let
go
and
she
can't
relax
and
just
before
she
hangs
her
head
to
cry
i
sing
to
her
a
lullaby
i
sing:
everything's
gonna
be
all
right
rock-a-bye
rock-a-bye
everything's
gonna
be

still
lives
with
her
mom
outside
the
city
down
that
street
about
a
half
a
mile
and
all
her
friends
tell
her
she's
so
pretty
but
she'd
be
a
whole
lot
prettier
if
she
smiled
once
in
a
while
'cause
even
her
smile
looks
like
a
frown
she's
seen
her
share
of
devils
in
this
angel
town
everything's
gonna
be

rock-a-bye
rock-a-bye
i
told
her
i
ain't
so
sure
about
this
place
it's
hard
to
play
a
gig
in
this
town
and
keep
a
straight
face
seems
like
everybody's
got
a
plan
it's
kind
of
like
nashville
with
a
tan
everything's

be

rock-a-bye
everything's

[repeat
chorus
until

it's
nothing
it's
so
normal
you
just
stand
there
i
could
say
so
much
but
i
don't
go
there
'cause
i
don't
want
to
and
i
was
thinking
if
you
were
lonely
maybe
we
could
leave
here
and
no
one
would
know
at
least
not
to
the
point
that
we
would
think
so
and
everyone
here
knows
everyone
here
is
thinking
about
somebody
else
well
it's
best
if
we
all
keep
this
under
our
heads
and
i
couldn't
tell
if
anyone
here
was
feeling
the
way
i
do
but
i'm
lonely
now
and
i
don't
know
how
to
get
it
back
to
good
this
don't
mean
that
you
own
me
well
this
ain't
no
good
in
fact
it's
phony
as
hell
yeah
but
things
worked
out
just
like
you
wanted
to
if
you
see
me
out
you
don't
know
me
try
to
turn
your
head
try
to
give
me
some
room
how
to
figure
out
just
what
i'm
gonna
do
'cause
everyone
here
hates
everyone
here
for
doing
just
like
they
do
and
it's
best
if
we
all
keep
this
quiet
instead
and
i
couldn't
tell
why
everyone
here
was
doing
me
like
they
do
but
i'm
sorry
now
and
i
don't
know
how
to
get
it
back
to
good
well
everyone
here
is
wondering
what
it's
like
to
be
with
somebody
else
and
everyone
here's
to
blame
and
everyone
here
gets
caught
up
in
the
pleasure
of
the
pain
well
everyone
here
hides
shades
of
shame
but
looking
inside
we're
the
same
we're
the
same
and
we're
all
grown
now
yeah
but
we
don't
know
how
to
get
it
back
to
good
well
everyone
here
knows
everyone
here
is
thinking
'bout
somebody
else
and
it's
best
if
we
all
keep
this
under
our
heads
in
our
heads
see
i
couldn't
tell
'bout
if
anyone
here

end
up
with
scars
tell
me
who
i
have
to
be
to
get
some
reciprocity
see
no
one
loves
you
more
than
me
and
no
one
ever
will
is
this
just
a
silly
game
that
forces
you
to
act
this
way
forces
you
to
scream
my
name
then
pretend
that
you
can't
stay
tell
me
who
i
have

we
gotta

no
one
loves
you
more

ever
will
no
matter
how
i

we
grow
you
always
seem
to
let
me
know
it
ain't
workin'
it
ain't
workin'
and
when
i
try

walk
away
you'd
hurt
yourself
to
make
me
stay
this
is
crazy
this
is

i
keep
letting
you
back
in
how
can
i
explain
myself
i
don't
understand
why
as
painful
as
this
thing
has
been
i
just
can't
be
with
no

you
down
in
my
bed
i
can't
wait
to

hole
in
your
life

you're
not
thinking
'bout
tomorrow
cuz
you
were
the
same
as

on
your
knees
a
thousand
other
boys
could
never
reach
you
how
could
i
have
been
the
one
i
saw
the
world
spin
beneath
you
and
scatter
like
ice
from
the

was
lying
on
the
grass
on
sunday
morning
of
last
week
indulging
in
my
self-defeat
my
mind
was
thugged
all
laced
and
bugged
all
twisted
wrong
and
beat
a
comfortable
in
three
feet
deep
now
the
fuzzy
stare
from
not
being
there
on
a
confusing
morning
week
impaired
my
tribal
lunar
speak
and
of
course
you
can't
become
if
you
only
say
what
you
would
have
done
so
i
missed
a
million
miles
of
fun
[marc
sharon:]
i
know
it's
up
for
me
if
you

i'm
not
in

in
to
making
straws
out
of
big
fat
slurpee
treats
an
incredible
eight
foot
heap
now
the
funny
glare
to
pay
a
gleaming
tare
in
a
staring
under
heat
involved
an
under
usual
feat

don't
you
ever
say
you
don't
like
the
way
you
are.
when
you
learn
to
love
yourself
you're
better
off
by
far.
and
i
hope
you
always
stay
the
same
cuz
there's
nothin'
'bout
you
i
would
change.
[verse]
i
think
that
you
could
be
whatever
you
wanted
to
be
if
you
could
realize
all
the
dreams
you
have
inside.
don't
be
afraid
if
you've
got
something
to
say
just
open
up
your
heart
and
let
it
show
you
the
way.
[chorus]

believe
in
yourself.
reach
down

the
love
you
find
will
set
you
free.

in
yourself
you
will
come
alive.
have
faith
in
what
you
do.
you'll
make
it
through.
[chorus]
and
i'd
give
up
forever
to
touch
you
'cause
i

that
you
feel
me
somehow
you're
the
closest
to
heaven
that
i'll
ever
be
and
i
don't
wanna
go
home
right
now
and
all
i
can
taste
is
this
moment
and
all
i
can
breathe
is
your
life
when
sooner
or
later
it's
over
i
just
don't
wanna
miss
you
tonight
and
i
don't
want
the
world
to
see
me
'cause
i
don't
think
that
they'd
understand
when
everything's
made
to
be
broken
i
just
want
you
to
know
who
i
am
and
you
can't
fight
the
tears
that
ain't
coming
or
the
moment
of
truth
in
your
lies

old
and
gray
with
you
in
good
and
bad
times
we'll
always

what
we
got
is
true
no
matter
what
they
say
to
you
i
could
straight
lace
you
not
just
appearance
stimulate
your
mind
strengthen
your
spirits
be
that
voice
of
reason
when
you
ain't
tryna
hear
it
you
want
it

you
fear
it

a
little
closer

ain't
dealin'
with
a
boy
feel
emptiness
inside
i
can
fill
that
void
when
you
spend
time
with
your
woman
and
listen
it
shines
more
than
any
bagguette
diamond
can
glisten
i
can't
impress
you
with
the
cars
and
the
wealth
cause
any
woman
with
will
and
drive
can
get
it
herself
i'd
rather
show
you
it's
heartfelt
make
your
heart
melt
and
prove
to
you
you're
more
important
than
anything
else
worthwhile
special
like
my
first
child
when
i
see
your
face
it's
always
like
the
first
time
our
eyes
met
i
knew
we'd
be
together
in
a
tri-jet

doubt
some

you
aware
of
what
we

rare
in
the
moment

the
courage
when
you're
scared
loyal
down
for
you
soon
as
i

was
running
out
of
time.
'cause
you
had
one
foot
out
the
door
i
swear
i
didn't
see
but
if
you're
really
going
away
here's
some
final
words
from
me.
[chorus:]
baby
write
this
down
take
a
little
note
to
remind
you
in
case
you
didn't
know
tell
yourself
i
love
you
and
i
don't
want
you
to
go
write
this
down.
take
my
words
read
'em
every
day
keep
'em
close
by
don't
you
let
'em
fade
away
so
you'll
remember
what
i
forgot
to
say
write
this
down.
i'll
sign
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
i'll
swear
under
oath
'cause
every
single
word
is
true
and
i
think
you
need
to
know
so
use
it
as
a
bookmark
stick
it
on
your
'frigerator
door
hang
it
in
a
picture
frame
up
above
the
mantel
where
you'll
see
it
for
sure.
[chorus]
you
can
find
a
chisel
i
can
find
a
stone.
folks
will
be
reading
these
words
long
after
we're
gone.
[chorus]
oh
i
love
you
and
i
don't
want
you
to
go
baby
write
this
down.
many
nights
we've
prayed
with
no
proof
anyone
could
hear
in
our
hearts
a
hopeful
song
we
barely
understood
now
we
are
not
afraid
although
we
know
there's
much
to
fear
we
were
moving
mountains
long
before
we
knew
we
could
there
can
be
miracles
when
you
believe
though
hope
is
frail
it's
hard
to
kill
who
knows
what
miracles
you
can
achieve
when
you
believe
somehow
you
will
you
will
when
you
believe
in
this
time
of
fear
when
prayer
so
often
proves
in
vain
hope
seems
like
the
summer
birds
too
swiftly
flown
away
yet
now
i'm
standing
here
my
heart's
so
full
i
can't
explain
seeking
faith
and
speaking
words
i
never
thought
i'd
say
there
can
be
miracles
when
you
believe
though
hope
is
frail
it's
hard
to
kill
who
knows
what
miracles
you
can
achieve
when
you
believe
somehow
you
will
you
will
when
you
believe
they
don't
always
happen
when
you
ask
and
it's
easy
to
give
in
to
your
fears
but
when
you're
blinded
by
your
pain
can't
see
your
way
clear
through
the
rain
a
small
but
still
resilient
voice
says
&quot;help
is
very
near&quot;
there
can
be
miracles
when
you
believe
though
hope
is
frail
it's
hard
to
kill
who
knows
what
miracles
you
can

when
you

somehow
you
will
now
you

when
you
