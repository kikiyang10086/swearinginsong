found
a
love
to
carry
more
than
just
my
secrets
to
carry
love
to
carry
children
of
our
own
we
are
still
kids
but
we're
so
in
love
fighting
against
all
odds

be
alright
this

i
don't
wanna
make
you
disappointed
it's
annoying
i
just
wanna

you
feel
like
everything
i
ever
do
was
never
tryna
make
an
issue
for
you
but
i
guess
the
more
you
thought
about
everything
you
were
never
even
wrong
in
the
first
place
right
yeah
i'ma
just
ignore
you
walking
towards
you
with
my
head
down
lookin'
at
the
ground
i'm
embarrassed
for
you
paranoia
what
did
i
do
wrong
this
time
that's
parents
for
you
very
loyal
shoulda
had
my
back
but
you
put
a
knife
in
it;
my
hands
are
full
what
else
should
i
carry
for
you
i
cared
for
you
but
feels
like
we're
on
the
edge
right
now
i
wish
that
i
could
say
i'm
proud
i'm
sorry
that
i
let
you
down
l-l-let
you
down

that
i
let
you
down
l-l-let
you
down
yeah
you
don't
wanna
make
this
work
you
just
wanna
make
this
worse
want
me
to
listen
to
you
but
you
don't
ever
hear
my
words
you
don't
wanna
know
my
hurt
yet
let
me
guess
you
want
an
apology
probably
how
can
we
keep
going
at
a
rate
like
this
we
can't
so
i
guess
i'ma
have
to
leave
please
don't
come
after
me
i
just
wanna
be
alone
right
now
i
don't
really
wanna
think
at
all
go
ahead
just
drink
it
off
both
know
you're
gonna
call
tomorrow
like
nothing's
wrong
ain't
that
what
you
always
do
i
feel
like
every
time
i
talk
to
you
you're
in
an
awful
mood
what
else
can
i
offer
you
there's
nothing
left
right
now
i
gave
it
all
to
you
feels
like
we're
on
the
edge
right
now
i
wish

that
we
could
have
made
this
work
and
probably
woulda
figured
things
out

be
together
ooh
i
fall
apart
down
to
my
core
ooh
i
fall
apart
down
to
my
core
ooh
didn't
know
it
before
surprised
when
you
caught
me
off
guard
all
this
damn
jewelry
i
bought
you
was
my
shorty
i
thought
ice

pourin'
and
the
drink
keep
flowin'
try
to
brush
it
off
but
it
keep
on
goin'
covered
in
scars
and
i
can't
help
showin'
whippin'
in
the
foreign
and
the
tears
keep
blowin'
ice
keep
droppin'
and
the
drink
keep
flowin'
try
to
brush
it
off
but
it
keep
on
goin'
all
these
scars
can't

from
showin'
whippin'
in
the
foreign
and
the
tears

yeah
ooh
i
fall

you
caught
me
off
guard
all
this
damn
jewelry
i
bought
you
was
my
shorty
i
thought
took
you
like
a
shot
thought
that
i
could
chase
you
with
the
cold
evening
let
a
couple
years
water
down
how
i'm
feeling
about
you
feeling
about
you
and
every
time
we
talk
every
single
word
builds
up
to
this
moment
and
i
gotta
convince
myself
i
don't
want
it
even
though
i
do
even
though
i
do
you
could
break
my
heart
in
two
but
when
it
heals
it
beats
for
you
i
know
it's
forward
but
it's
true
i
wanna
hold
you
when
i'm
not
supposed
to
when
i'm
lying
close
to
someone
else
you're
stuck
in
my
head
and
i
can't
get
you
out
of
it
if
i
could
do
it
all
again
i
know
i'd
go
back
to
you
i
know
i'd
go
back
to
you
i
know
i'd
go
back
to
you
we
never
got
it
right
playing
and
re-playing
old
conversations
over-thinking
every
word
and
i
hate
it
'cause
it's
not
me
'cause
it's
not
me
and
what's
the
point
in
hiding
everybody
knows
we
got
unfinished
business
and
i
regret
it
if
i
didn't
say
this
isn't
what
it
could
be
isn't
what
it
could
be
you
could
break
my
heart

are

you've

you
just
might
be
doing
whatever
it
takes
to
drown
out
the
noise

i
just
wanna
hear

i'm

number
away
from
calling

you
i
said
i
was
through
but
i'm
dying
inside
got
my
head
in
a
mess
girl
i
confess
i
lied
when
i
said
&quot;i'm
leaving
and
not
coming
back&quot;
might
be
the
whiskey
or
the
midnight
rain
but
everywhere
i
go
i
see
your
face
in
my
brain
dialing
up
everything
i
want
to
say
but
i'm
still
one
number
away
are
you
stuck
at
a
red
light
with
a
marlboro
light
on
your
lips
does
the
smoke
in
your
mirror
get
clearer
without
my

are
you
changing
the
station
replacing
our
favorite
song
maybe
it's
a
mistake
hit
the
brakes
on
the
moving
on
well
if
you're
anything

me
you
just
might
be
doing
whatever
it
takes
to
outrun
the
storm
