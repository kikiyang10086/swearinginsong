lyrics
i
walked
through
the
door
with
you
the
air
was
cold
but
somethin'
'bout
it
felt
like
home
somehow
and
i
left
my
scarf
there
at
your
sister's
house
and
you've
still
got
it
in
your
drawer
even
now


oh
your
sweet
disposition
and
my
wide-eyed
gaze
we're
singin'
in
the
car
getting
lost
upstate
autumn
leaves
fallin'
down
like
pieces
into
place
and
i
can
picture
it
after
all
these
days


and
i
know
it's
long
gone
and
that
magic's
not
here
no
more
and
i
might
be
okay
but
i'm
not
fine
at
all
oh
oh
oh


'causе
there
we
arе
again
on
that
little
town
street
you
almost
ran
the
red
'cause
you
were
lookin'
over
at
me
wind
in
my
hair
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well


photo
album
on
the
counter
your
cheeks
were
turnin'
red
you
used
to
be
a
little
kid
with
glasses
in
a
twin-sized
bed
and
your
mother's
tellin'
stories
'bout
you
on
the
tee-ball
team
you
taught
me
'bout
your
past
thinkin'
your
future
was
me
and
you
were
tossing
me
the
car
keys
"fuck
the
patriarchy"
keychain
on
the
ground
we
were
always
skippin'
town
and
i
was
thinkin'
on
the
drive
down
"any
time
now
he's
gonna
say
it's
love"
you
never
called
it
what
it
was
'til
we
were
dead
and
gone
and
buried
check
the
pulse
and
come
back
swearin'
it's
the
same
after
three
months
in
the
grave
and
then
you
wondered
where
it
went
to
as
i
reached
for
you
but
all
i
felt
was
shame
and
you
held
my
lifeless
frame
see

as
low
as

might
also
like
and
i
know
it's
long
gone
and
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
and
i
forget
about
you
long
enough
to
forget
why
i
needed
to


'cause
there
we
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we're
dancin'
'round
the
kitchen
in
the
refrigerator
light
down
the
stairs
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
and
there
we
are
again
when
nobody
had
to
know
you
kept
me
like
a
secret
but
i
kept
you
like
an
oath
sacred
prayer
and
we'd
swear
to
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah


well
maybe
we
got
lost
in
translation
maybe
i
asked
for
too
much
but
maybe
this
thing
was
a
masterpiece
'til
you
tore
it
all
up
runnin'
scared
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
and
you
call
me
up
again
just
to
break
me
like
a
promise
so
casually
cruel
in
the
name
of
bein'
honest
i'm
a
crumpled-up
piece
of
paper
lyin'
here
'cause
i
remember
it
all
all
all

they
say
all's
well
that
ends
well
but
i'm
in
a
new
hell
every
time
you
double-cross
my
mind
you
said
if
we
had
been
closer
in
age
maybe
it
would've
been
fine
and
that
made
me
want
to
die
the
idea
you
had
of
me
who
was
she
a
never-needy
ever-lovely
jewel
whose
shine
reflects
on
you
not
weepin'
in
a
party
bathroom
some
actress
askin'
me
what
happened
you
that's
what
happened
you
you
who
charmed
my
dad
with
self-effacing
jokes
sippin'
coffee
like
you're
on
a
late-night
show
but
then
he
watched
me
watch
the
front
door
all
night
willin'
you
to
come
and
he
said
"it's
supposed
to
be
fun
turning
twenty-one"


time
won't
fly
it's
like
i'm
paralyzed
by
it
i'd
like
to
be
my
old
self
again
but
i'm
still
tryin'
to
find
it
after
plaid
shirt
days
and
nights
when
you
made
me
your
own
now
you
mail
back
my
things
and
i
walk
home
alone
but
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
that
very
first
week
'cause
it
reminds
you
of
innocence
and
it
smells
like
me
you
can't
get
rid
of
it
'cause
you
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah


'cause
there
we
are
again
when
i
loved
you
so
back
before
you
lost
the
one
real

"i'll

"well
it's
made
for
me"
how
evergreen
our
group
of
friends
don't
think
we'll
say
that
word
again
and
soon
they'll
have
the
nerve
to
deck
the
halls
that
we
once
walked
through
one
for
the
money
two
for
the
show
i
never
was
ready
so
i
watch
you
go
sometimes
you
just
don't
know
the
answer
'til
someone's
on
their
knees
and
asks
you
"she
would've
made
such
a
lovely
bride
what
a
shame
she's
fucked
in
the
head"
they
said
but
you'll
find
the
real
thing
instead
she'll
patch
up
your
tapestry
that
i
shred


and
hold
your
hand
while
dancing
never
leave
you
standing
crestfallen
on
the
landing
with
champagne
problems
your
mom's
ring
in
your
pocket
her
picture
in
your
wallet
you
won't
remember
all
my
champagne
problems

won't
remember

pulled

walked
through
the

with
you
the
air
was
cold
but
something
'bout
it
felt
like
home

i
left
my

there
at

you've
still

it
in

drawer
even
now


oh
your
sweet
disposition
and
my
wide-eyed
gaze
we're
singing
in
the
car
getting
lost
upstate
autumn
leaves
falling
down
like
pieces
into
place
and
i
can
picture
it
after
all
these
days


and
i
know
it's
long
gone
and
that
magic's
not

i
might

i'm

all
oh
oh
oh


'cause
there
we
are
again
on
that
little

you
almost
ran

'cause
you
were
lookin'

with

in
a

'cause
there
we
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we're
dancing
‘round
the
kitchen
in
the
refrigerator

down
the
stairs
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all

yeah


well
maybe
we
got
lost
in
translation
maybe
i
asked
for
too
much
but
maybe
this
thing
was
a
masterpiece
'til
you
tore
it
all
up
running
scared
i
was
there
i
remember
it
all
too
well
and
you
call
me
up
again
just
to
break
me
like
a
promise
so
casually
cruel
in
the
name
of
being
honest
i'm
a
crumpled
up
piece
of
paper
lying
here
'cause
i
remember
it
all
all
all
too
well

time
won't
fly
it's
like
i'm
paralyzed
by
it
i'd
like
to
be
my
old
self
again
but
i'm
still
trying
to
find
it
after
plaid
shirt
days
and
nights
when
you
made
me
your
own
now
you
mail
back
my
things
and
i
walk
home
alone
but
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
that
very
first
week
'cause
it
reminds
you
of
innocence
and
it
smells
like
me
you
can't
get
rid
of
it
'cause
you
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah


'cause
there
we
are
again
when
i
loved
you
so
back
before
you
lost
the
one
real
thing
you've
ever
known
it
was
rare
i
was
there
i
remember
it

hair
you
were
there
