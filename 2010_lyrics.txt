picture
perfect
memories
scattered
all
around
the
floor
reaching
for
the
phone
'cause
i
can't
fight
it
anymore
and
i
wonder
if
i
ever
cross
your
mind
for
me
it
happens
all
the
time
it's
a
quarter
after
one
i'm
all
alone
and
i
need
you
now
said
i
wouldn't
call
but
i've
lost
all
control
and
i
need
you
now
and
i
don't
know
how
i
can
do
without
i
just
need
you
now
another
shot
of
whiskey
can't
stop
looking
at
the
door
wishing
you'd
come
sweeping
in
the
way
you
did
before
and
i
wonder
if
i
ever
cross
your
mind
for
me
it
happens
all
the
time
it's
a
quarter
after
one
i'm
a
little
drunk
and
i
need
you
now
said
i
wouldn't
call
but
i've
lost
all
control
and
i
need
you
now
and
i
don't
know
how
i
can
do
without
i
just
need
you
now
oh
whoa
guess
i'd
rather
hurt
than
feel
nothing
at
all
it's
a
quarter
after
one
i'm
all
alone
and
i
need

there
comes
a

you
fade
to

and
when
you're
starin'
at
that
phone
in
your
lap
and
you're
hopin'
but
them
people
never
call
you
back
but
that's
just
how
the

unfolds
you
get
another
hand
soon
after
you
fold

unravel
in

what

don't
close
that

if
i
don't
make
that
then
i'll
switch
my
flight
and
i'll
be
right
back
at
it
by
the
end
of
the
night

somebody
take
me
back

before
this

a
job
before
i
got
paid
before
it
ever
mattered
what
i
had
in
my
bank
yeah
back
when
i
was
tryin'
to
get
a
tip
at

back
when
i
was
rappin'
for
the
hell
of
it
but
nowadays
we
rappin'
to
stay

that
if
we
could
make
some
wishes
outta'
airplanes
then
maybe
oh
maybe
i'd
go
back

the
days
before
the
politics
that

a

a
wish
right
now
just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
well
that's
alright
because
i
like
the
way
it
hurts
just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
well
that's
alright
because
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i
can't
tell
you
what
it
really
is
i
can
only
tell
you
what
it
feels
like
and
right
now
there's
a
steel
knife
in
my
windpipe
i
can't
breathe
but
i
still
fight
while
i
can
fight
as
long
as
the
wrong
feels
right
it's
like
i'm
in
flight
high
off
her
love
drunk
from
her
hate
it's
like
i'm
huffing
paint
and
i
love
her
the
more
i
suffer
i
suffocate
and
right
before
i'm
about
to
drown
she
resuscitates
me
she
fucking
hates
me
and
i
love
it
&quot;wait
where
you
going&quot;
&quot;i'm
leaving
you&quot;
&quot;no
you
ain't.
come
back&quot;
we're
running
right
back
here
we
go
again
it's
so
insane
'cause
when
it's
going
good
it's
going
great
i'm
superman
with
the
wind
at
his
back
she's
lois
lane
but
when
it's
bad
it's
awful
i
feel
so
ashamed
i
snap
&quot;who's
that
dude&quot;
&quot;i
don't
even
know
his
name&quot;
i
laid
hands
on
her
i'll
never
stoop
so
low
again
i
guess
i
don't
know
my
own
strength
just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
well
that's
alright
because
i
like
the
way
it
hurts
just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
well
that's
alright
because
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i
love
the
way
you
lie
you
ever
love
somebody
so
much
you
can
barely
breathe
when
you're
with
'em
you
meet
and
neither
one
of
you
even
know
what
hit
'em
got
that
warm
fuzzy
feeling
yeah
them
chills
used
to
get
'em
now
you're
getting
fucking
sick
of
looking
at
'em
you
swore
you'd
never
hit
'em;
never
do
nothing
to
hurt
'em
now
you're
in
each
other's
face
spewing
venom
in
your
words
when
you
spit
them
you
push
pull
each
other's
hair
scratch
claw
bit
'em
throw
'em
down
pin
'em
so
lost
in
the
moments
when
you're
in
them
it's
the
rage
that
took
over
it
controls
you
both
so
they
say
it's
best
to
go
your
separate
ways
guess
that
they
don't
know
you
'cause
today
that
was
yesterday
yesterday
is
over
it's
a
different
day
sound
like
broken
records
playing
over
but
you
promised
her
next
time
you'd
show
restraint
you
don't
get
another
chance
life
is
no
nintendo
game
but
you
lied
again
now
you
get
to
watch
her
leave
out
the
window
guess
that's
why
they
call
it
window
pane
just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
well
that's
alright
because
i
like
the
way
it
hurts
just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
well
that's
alright
because
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i
love
the
way
you
lie
now
i
know
we
said
things
did
things
that
we
didn't
mean
and
we
fall
back
into
the
same
patterns
same
routines
but
your
temper's
just
as
bad
as
mine
is
you're
the
same
as
me
when
it
comes
to
love
you're
just
as
blinded
baby
please
come
back
it
wasn't
you
baby
it
was
me
maybe
our
relationship
isn't
as
crazy
as
it
seems
maybe
that's
what
happens
when
a
tornado
meets
a
volcano
all
i
know
is
i
love
you
too
much
to
walk
away
though
come
inside
pick
up
your
bags
off
the
sidewalk
don't
you
hear
sincerity
in
my
voice
when
i
talk
told
you
this
is
my
fault
look
me
in
the
eyeball
next
time
i'm
pissed
i'll
aim
my
fist
at
the
drywall
next
time
there
won't
be
no
next
time
i
apologize
even
though
i
know
it's
lies
i'm
tired
of
the
games
i
just
want
her
back
i
know
i'm
a
liar
if
she
ever
tries
to
fucking
leave
again
i'mma
tie
her
to
the
bed
and
set
this
house
on
fire
i'm
just
gonna
just
gonna
stand
there
and

me
burn
well
that's
alright

try
to
ask
him
why
or
how
can
he
from
&quot;infinite&quot;
down
to
the
last
&quot;relapse&quot;
album
he's
still
shitting
whether
he's
on
salary
paid
hourly
until
he
bows
out
or
he
shits
his
bowels
out
of
him
whichever
comes
first
for
better
or
worse
he's
married
to
the
game
like
a
&quot;fuck
you&quot;
for
christmas
his
gift
is
a
curse
forget
the
earth
he's
got
the
urge
to
pull
his
dick
from
the
dirt
and
fuck
the
whole
universe
i'm
not
afraid
i'm
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
to
take
a
stand
everybody
everybody
come
take
my
hand
come
take
my

walk
this

whatever
weather
cold
or
warm
just
letting
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
holler
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
same
road
okay
quit
playing
with
the
scissors
and
shit
and
cut
the
crap
i
shouldn't
have
to
rhyme
these
words
in
a
rhythm
for
you
to
know
it's
a
rap
you
said
you
was
king
you
lied
through
your
teeth
for
that
fuck
your
feelings
instead
of
getting
crowned
you're
getting
capped
and
to
the
fans
i'll
never
let
you
down
again
i'm
back
i
promise
to
never
go
back
on
that
promise
in
fact
let's
be
honest
that
last
&quot;relapse&quot;
cd
was
&quot;ehh&quot;
perhaps
i
ran
them
accents
into
the
ground
relax
i
ain't
going
back
to
that
now
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
get
back
click-clack
blow
'cause
i
ain't
playing
around
there's
a
game
called
circle
and
i
don't
know
how
i'm
way
too
up
to
back
down
but
i
think
i'm
still
trying
to
figure
this
crap
out
thought
i
had
it
mapped
out
but
i
guess
i
didn't
this
fucking
black
cloud
still
follows
me
around
but
it's
time
to
exorcise
these
demons
these
motherfuckers
are
doing
jumping
jacks
now
i'm
not
afraid
i'm
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
to
take
a
stand
everybody
everybody
come
take
my
hand
come
take
my
hand
we'll
walk
this
road
together
through
the
storm
whatever
weather
cold
or
warm
just
letting
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
holler
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
same
road
and
i
just
can't
keep
living
this
way
so
starting
today
i'm
breaking
out
of
this
cage
i'm
standing
up
i'mma
face
my
demons
i'm
manning
up
i'mma
hold
my
ground
i've
had
enough
now
i'm
so
fed
up
time
to
put
my
life
back
together
right
now
now
it
was
my
decision
to
get
clean
i
did
it
for
me
admittedly
i
probably
did
it
subliminally
for
you
so
i
could
come
back
a
brand-new
me
you
helped
see
me
through
and
don't
even
realize
what
you
did
'cause
believe
me
you
i've
been
through
the
wringer
but
they
could
do
little
to
the
middle
finger
i
think
i
got
a
tear
in
my
eye
i
feel
like
the
king
of
my
world
haters
can
make
like
bees
with
no
stingers
and
drop
dead
no
more
beef
lingers
no
more
drama
from
now
on
i
wanna
promise
to
focus
solely
on
handling
my
responsibilities
as
a
father
so
i
solemnly
swear
to
always
treat
this
roof
like
my
daughters
and
raise
it
you
couldn't
lift
a
single
shingle
on
it
'cause
the
way
i
feel
i'm
strong
enough
to
go
to
the
club
or
the
corner
pub
and
lift
the
whole
liquor
counter
up
'cause
i'm
raising
the
bar
i'd
shoot
for
the
moon
but
i'm
too
busy
gazing
at
stars
i
feel
amazing
and
i'm...
i'm
not
afraid
i'm
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
to
take
a
stand
everybody
everybody
come
take
my
hand
come
take
my
hand
we'll
walk
this
road
together
through
the
storm
whatever
weather
cold
or
warm
just
letting
you
know
that
you're

you
feel

you've
been
down
the
same
road

road

off
a
poster
that
girl
is
a

in

number
one
spot
now
she
found
her
a

i
can't
take
it
knowing
somebody's
got
my
baby
and
now
you
ain't
around
baby
i
can't
think
i
shoulda
put
it
down
shoulda
got
that
ring
'cause
i
can
still
feel
it
in
the
air
see
her
pretty
face
run
my
fingers
through
her
hair
my
love
of
my
life
my
shorty
my
wife
she
left
me
i'm
tight
'cause
i
knew
that
it
just
ain't

never
looked
back
i
was
a
flight
risk
with
a
fear

falling
wondering

it
never
lasts

taking
on
the
world
together
and
there's
a
drawer
of
my
things
at
your
place
you
learn
my
secrets
and
you
figure
out
why
i'm
guarded
you
say
we'll
never
make
my
parents'
mistakes
but
we
got
bills

put
your
arm
around

the
first
time
you
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
man's
careful
daughter

are
the
best
thing
that's
ever

careless
man's
careful
daughter

of
our
hands

ran
out
crying

street

myself
for
the
&quot;goodbye&quot;
'cause

me

you
alone.&quot;

felt
sitting
by
the
water

time

look
at
you

first
time

fell
in
love
with
a
careless
man's
careful
daughter

the
best
thing

mine.&quot;

sometimes
we

back
up
we're

behind
skin
that's

you&quot;
enough
'til

it's
not

our

are
hungry
for
a
food
that
won't
come
and
we
could
make
a
feast
from
these
crumbs

all
staring
down
the
barrel
of
a
gun

flashed
before
you
what
would
you
wish

is
all
we
got
then
we
gotta
start
thinking
if
every
second
counts
on
a
clock
that's
ticking
gotta
live
like
we're
dying
we
only
got
86400

in
a

to
turn
it

throw
it
all
away
we

we
love
them

live
like

and
if
your
plane
fell
out
of
the
skies
who
would
you
call
with
your
last
goodbye
should
be
so
careful
who
we
let
fall
out
of
our

we
long
for
absolution
there'll
be
no

down

you're
on
the
phone
with
your
girlfriend
she's
upset
she's
going
off
about
something
that
you
said
'cause
she
doesn't
get
your
humor
like
i
do
i'm
in
the
room
it's
a
typical
tuesday
night
i'm
listening
to
the
kind
of
music
she
doesn't
like
and
she'll
never
know
your
story
like
i
do
but
she
wears
short
skirts
i
wear
t-shirts
she's
cheer
captain
and
i'm
on
the
bleachers
dreaming
about
the
day
when
you
wake
up
and
find
that
what
you're
looking
for
has
been
here
the
whole
time
if
you
could
see
that
i'm
the
one
who
understands
you
been
here
all
along
so
why
can't
you
see
you
belong
with
me
you
belong
with
me
walk
in
the
streets
with
you
in
your
worn-out
jeans
i
can't
help
thinking
this
is
how
it
ought
to
be
laughing
on
a
park
bench
thinking
to
myself
&quot;hey
isn't
this
easy&quot;
and
you've
got
a
smile
that
could
light
up
this
whole
town
i
haven't
seen
it
in
a
while
since
she
brought
you
down
you
say
you're
fine
i
know
you
better
than
that
hey
what
you
doing
with
a
girl
like
that
she
wears
high
heels
i
wear
sneakers
she's
cheer
captain
and
i'm
on
the
bleachers
dreaming
about
the

here
all
along

by
and
waiting
at
your
backdoor

down
whenever
you're
around

can
you
feel
this
magic
in
the
air

must
have
been
the
way
you
kissed
me
fell
in
love
when
i
saw
you
standing
there

got
a
smile
that
takes
me
to
another

make
everything
you
say
is
right
today
was
a
fairytale
today
was
a
fairytale
all
that
i
can
say

clearer
nothing
made
sense
'til
the
time
i
saw
your
face
today
was
a

beating
in
my
chest
did
you
feel

i
can't
put
this
down

last
time.

from
adam.

up
those
stairs
in
that
little
back
bedroom
is
where
i
did
my
homework
and
i
learned
to
play
guitar.
and
i
bet
you
didn't
know
under
that
live
oak
my
favorite
dog
is
buried
in
the
yard.
i
thought
if
i
could
touch
this
place
or
feel
it
this
brokenness
inside
me
might
start
healing.
out
here
it's
like
i'm
someone
else
i
thought
that
maybe
i
could
find
myself
if
i
could
just
come
in
i
swear
i'll
leave.
won't
take
nothing
but
a
memory
from
the
house
that
built
me.
mama
cut
out
pictures
of
houses
for
years.
from
'better
homes
and
garden'
magazine.
plans
were
drawn
concrete
poured
and
nail
by
nail
and
board
by
board
daddy
gave
life
to
mama's
dream.
i
thought
if
i
could
touch
this
place
or
feel
it
this
brokenness
inside
me
might
start
healing.
out
here
it's
like
i'm
someone
else
i
thought
that
maybe
i
could
find
myself.
if
i
could
just
come
in
i
swear
i'll
leave.
won't
take
nothing
but
a
memory
from
the
house
that
built
me.
you
leave
home
you
move
on
and
you
do
the
best
you
can.
i
got
lost
in
this
old
world
and
forgot
who
i
am.
i
thought
if
i
could
touch
this
place
or
feel
it
this
brokenness
inside
me
might
start
healing.
out
here
it's
like
i'm
someone
else
i
thought
that
maybe
i
could
find
myself.
if
i
could
walk
around
i
swear
i'll
leave.
won't
take
nothing
but
a
memory
from
the
house
that
built
me.
when
i
was
younger
i
saw
my
daddy
cry
and
curse
at
the
wind
he
broke
his
own
heart
and
i
watched
as
he
tried
to
reassemble
it
and
my
momma
swore
that
she
would
never
let
herself
forget
and
that
was
the
day
that
i
promised
i'd
never
sing
of
love
if
it
does
not
exist
but
darling
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
maybe
i
know
somewhere
deep
in
my
soul
that
love
never
lasts
and
we've
got
to
find
other
ways
to
make
it
alone
or
keep
a
straight
face
and
i've
always
lived
like
this
keeping
a
comfortable
distance
and
up
until
now
i
had
sworn
to
myself
that
i'm
content
with
loneliness
because
none
of
it
was
ever
worth
the
risk
well
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
i've
got
a
tight
grip
on
reality
but
i
can't
let
go
of
what's
in
front
of
me
here
i
know
you're
leaving
in
the
morning
when
you
wake
up
leave
me
with
some
kind
of
proof
it's
not
a
dream
oh-oh-oh-oh
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
you
are
the
only
exception
and
i'm
on
my
way
to
believing
oh
and
i'm
on
my
way
to
believing
she
grew
up
on
the
side
of
the
road
where
the
church
bells
ring
and
strong
love
grows
she
grew
up
good
she
grew
up
slow
like
american
honey

as
a
preacher

things
i'd
say
if
only
i
were
able

i
just
keep
quiet
and
count
the
cars
that
pass
by

got
opinions

to
'em

to
you

not
drowning

no
one
here
to
save
who

if
you
disagree

are
not
me
who
made
you
king
of
anything

of
anything

sound
so
innocent
all
full
of
good
intent
you
swear
you
know
best
but
you
expect
me
to
jump
up
on
board
with
you
and
ride
off
into
your
delusional
sunset
i'm
not
the
one
who's
lost
with
no
direction

never

them
in
all
caps

the
talkin'

my
life

tried
to
make
everybody
happy
while
i
just
hurt
and
hide
waitin'
for
someone
to
tell
me
it's
my
turn
to
decide
who
cares
if
you
disagree

are
not
me
who
made
you
king
of
anything
so

let
me
hold
your
crown
babe
ten
miles
from
town
and
i
just
broke
down
spittin'
out
smoke
on
the
side
of
the
road
i'm
out
here
alone
just
tryin'
to
get
home
to
tell
you
i
was
wrong
but
you
already
know
believe
me
i
won't
stop
at
nothin'
to
see
you
so
i've
started
runnin'
all
that
i'm
after
is
a
life
full
of
laughter
as
long
as
i'm
laughing
with
you
i'm
thinking
that
all
that
still
matters
is
love
ever
after
after
the
life
we've
been
through
'cause
i
know
there's
no
life
after
you
last
time
we
talked
the
night
that
i
walked
burns
like
an
iron
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
must've
been
high
to
say
you
and
i
weren't
meant
to
be
and
just
wasting
my
time
oh
why
did
i
ever
doubt
you
you
know
i
would
die
here
without
you
all
that
i'm
after
is
a
life
full
of
laughter
as
long
as
i'm
laughing
with
you
i'm
thinking
that
all
that
still
matters
is
love
ever
after
after
the
life
we've
been
through
'cause
i
know
there's
no
life
after
you
you
and
i
right
or
wrong
there's
no
other
one
after
this
time
i
spent
alone
it's
hard
to
believe
that
a
man
with
sight
could
be
so
blind
thinkin'
'bout
the
better
times
must've
been
outta
my
mind
so
i'm
runnin'
back
to
tell
you
all
that
i'm
after
is
a
life
full
of
laughter
without
you
god
knows
what
i'd
do
yeah
all
that
i'm
after
is
a
life
full
of
laughter
as
long
as
i'm
laughing
with
you
i'm
thinking
that
all
that
still
matters
is
love
ever
after
after
the
life
we've
been
through
yeah
know
there's
no
life
after
you

poking
through
the
sidewalk
crack
and
just

that
you
steal
away
the
rain
and
