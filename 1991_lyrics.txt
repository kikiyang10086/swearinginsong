pushing
down
the

bringing
out
your
higher
self
think
of
the
fine
times
pushing
down
the

few
instead

everything
your
asked

brace
yourself
with
the

from
a
distance
the
world
looks
blue
and
green
and
the
snow-capped
mountains
white.
from
a
distance
the
ocean
meets
the
stream
and
the
eagle
takes
to
flight.
from
a
distance
there
is
harmony
and
it
echoes
through
the
land.
it's
the
voice
of
hope
it's
the
voice
of
peace
it's
the
voice
of
every
man.
from
a
distance
we
all
have
enough
and
no
one
is
in
need.
and
there
are
no
guns
no
bombs
and
no
disease
no
hungry
mouths
to
feed.
from
a
distance
we
are
instruments
marching
in
a
common
band.
playing
songs
of
hope
playing
songs
of
peace.
they're
the
songs
of
every
man.
god
is
watching
us.
god
is
watching
us.
god
is
watching
us
from
a
distance.
from
a
distance
you
look
like
my
friend
even
though
we
are
at
war.
from
a
distance
i
just
cannot
comprehend
what
all
this
fighting
is
for.
from
a
distance
there
is
harmony
and
it
echoes
through
the
land.
and
it's
the
hope
of
hopes
it's
the
love
of
loves
it's
the
heart
of
every
man.
it's
the
hope
of
hopes
it's
the
love
of
loves.
this
is
the
song
of
every
man.
and
god
is
watching
us
god
is
watching
us
god
is
watching
us

is
watching.

distance.
i
used
to
cry
myself
to
sleep
at
night
but
that
was
all
before
he
came
i
thought
love
had
to
hurt
to
turn
out
right
but
now
he's
here
it's
not
the
same
it's
not
the
same
he
fills
me
up
he
gives
me
love
more
love
than
i've
ever
seen
he's
all
i've
got
he's
all
i've
got
in
this
world
but
he's
all
the
man
that
i
need
and
in
the

once
again
we
sit
in
silence
after
all
is
said
and
done
only
emptiness
inside
us
baby
look
what
we've
become
we
can
make
a
million
promises
but
we
still
won't
change
it
isn't
right
to
stay
together
when
you
only
bring
each
other
pain
i
don't
wanna
cry
don't
wanna
cry
nothing
in
the
world
could
take
us
back
to
where
we
used
to
be
though
i've
given
you
my
heart
and
soul
given
you
my
heart
and
soul
i
must
find
a
way
of
letting
go
'cause
baby
i
don't
wanna
cry
i
don't
wanna
cry
too
far
apart
to
bridge
the
distance
but
something
keeps
us
hanging
on
and
on
pretending
not
to
know
the
difference
denying
what
we
had
is
gone
every
moment
we're
together
it's
just
breaking
me
down
i
know
we
swore
it
was
forever
but
it
hurts
too
much
to
stay
around
i
don't
wanna
cry
don't
wanna
cry
nothing
in
the
world
could
take
us
back
to
where
we
used
to
be
though
i've
given
you
my
heart
and

don't
wanna
cry

don't
wanna
cry
no

all
the
magic's
gone
there's
just
a
shadow
of
a
memory
something
just
went
wrong
we
can't
go
on
make-believing
on
make-believing
'cause
i
don't
wanna
cry
don't
wanna
cry

now
i'll
let
you
go
'cause
i

to
believe
that
you're
never
coming
back
to
me
i've
had
this
dream
that
you'd
always
be
by
my
side
oh
i
could
have
died.
but
now
i

to
find
you

was
praying
that
fate
would
bring
you
back
to
me
someday
someday
someday...
ooh
you're
in
love

in
love

saw
you
try
every
whisper
of
every
waking
hour
i'm
choosing
my
confessions
trying
to
keep
an
eye
on
you

a
hurt
lost
and
blinded
fool

set
it
up
consider
this

the
hint
of
the
century
consider
this
the
slip
that
brought
me
to
my
knees
failed
what
if
all
these
fantasies
come
flailing
around
now

much
i
thought
that
i
heard
you
laughing
i
thought
that
i
heard
you
sing
i
think
i
thought

saw
you
try
but
that
was
just
a
dream

was
just
a
dream
that's
me
in
the
corner
that's
me
in
the
spotlight
losing
my
religion
trying
to
keep
up
with
you
and
i
don't
know
if
i
can

not
alone
life
is
never
easy
the
rest
in
unknown
up
to
now
for
me
it's
been
hands
against
stone
each
and
every
moment
searching
for
what
to
believe
coming
out
of
the
dark
i
finally
see
the
light
now
and
it's
shining
on
me
coming
out
of
the
dark
i
know
the
love
that
saved
me
sharing
with
me
starting
again

the
plan

stronger

your
hand
step
by
step

make
it
through

i
can
may
not
make
it
easier

felt
you

all
the
way

the
dark

much
to

-
we
were
lost
in
time
everything
i
needed
i
feel
in
your
eyes
always
thought
of
keeping
-
your
heart
next
to
mine
but
now
that
seems
so
far
away
don't
know
how
love
could
leave
without
a
trace
where
do
silent
hearts
go
where
does
my
heart
beat
now
where
is
the
sound
that
only
echoes
through
the
night
where
does
my
heart
beat
now
i
can't
live
without
without
feeling
it
inside
where
do
all
the
lonely
hearts
go
candle
in
the
water
-
drifting
helplessly
hiding
from
the
thunder-
come
and
rescue
me
driven
by
hunger
-
of
the
endless
dream
i'm
searching
for
the
hand
that
i
can
hold
i'm
reaching
for
the
arms
that
let
me
know
where
do
silent
hearts
go
where
does
my
heart
beat
now
where
is
the
sound
that
only
echoes
through
the
night
where
does
my
heart
beat
now
i
can't
live
without
without
feeling
it
inside
where
do
all
the
lonely
hearts
go
where
do
all
the
lonely
hearts
go
then
one
touch
overcomes
the
silence
love
still
survives
two
hearts
needing
one
another
give
me
wings
to
fly
where
does
my
heart
beat
now
where
is
the
sound
that
only
echoes
through
the
night
where
does
my
heart
beat
now
i
can't
live
without
without
feeling
it
inside
i've
got
someone
to
give
my
heart
to
feel
it
getting
stronger
and
stronger
and
stronger
and

can't
be
filled
with

i
do
hole-hearted
hole-hearted
this
heart
of
stone
is
where
i
hide
these
feet
of
clay
kept
warm
inside
day
by
day
less
satisfied
not
fade
away
before
i
die

to
overload

something

to
try

every
day
i'm
more
confused
as
the
saints
turn
into
sinners
all
the
heroes
and
legends
i
knew
as
a
child
have
fallen
to
idols
of
clay
and
i
feel
this
empty
place
inside
so
afraid
that
i've
lost
my
faith
show
me
the
way
show
me
the
way
take
me
tonight
to
the
river
and

my
illusions
away

show
me
the
way
and
as
i
slowly
drift
to
sleep
for
a
moment
dreams
are
sacred
i
close
my
eyes
and
know
there's
peace
in
a
world
so
filled
with
hatred
then
i
wake
up
each
morning
and
turn
on
the
news
to
find
we've
so
far
to
go
and
i
keep
on
hoping
for
a
sign
so
afraid
i
just
won't
know
show
me
the
way
show
me
the
way
bring
me
tonight
to
the
mountain
and
take
my
confusion
away
and
show
me
the
way
and
if
i
see
your
light
should
i
believe
tell
me
how
will
i
know
show
me
the
way
show
me
the
way

me
tonight
to
the
river

my
illusions
away

me
the
way

me
the
way

me
the
strength
and
the
courage
to
believe
that
i'll
get
there
someday

me
the
way

night
i

a
prayer
in
the
hopes
that
there's
a
heaven...

had
it
all

i
let
it
slip
away

i
treated
you
wrong
now
i
wander
around
feeling
down
and
cold
trying
to
believe
that
you're
gone
love
takes
time
to
heal
when
you're
hurting
so
much
couldn't
see
that
i
was
blind
to
let
you
go
i
can't
escape
the
pain
inside
because
love
takes
time
i
don't
wanna
be
here
i
don't
wanna
be
here
alone
losing
my
mind
from
this
hollow
in
my
heart
suddenly
i'm
so
incomplete
lord
i
need
you
now
tell
me
how
to
stop
the
rain
tears
are
falling
down
endlessly

time
to
heal
when
you're
hurting
so
much
couldn't
see
that
i
was

alone
you
might
say
that
it's
over
you
might
say
that
you
don't
care
you
might
say
you
don't
miss
me
you
don't
need
me

i
know
that
you
do
and

you
do
inside

she's
taken
my
time
convinced
me
she's
fine
but
when
she
leaves
i'm
not
so
sure
it's
always
the
same
she's
playing
her
game
and
when
she
goes
i
feel
to
blame
why
won't
she
say
she
needs
me
i
know
she's
not
as
strong
as
she
seems

&quot;long-haired
freaky
people

so
i
put
my
hair
up
under
my

went
in
to
ask
him
why
he
said
you
look
like
a
fine
outstanding
young
man
i
think
you'll

took
off
my
hat
i
said
&quot;imagine

and
the
sign
says
&quot;anybody
caught
trespassing
will
be
shot
on

so
i
jumped
the
fence
and
i
yelled
at
the
house
hey
what
gives
you
the
right
to
put
up
a
fence
and
keep
me
out
or

and
the

says
&quot;everybody

come
in
kneel
down
and

but
then
they
passed
around

plate
at
the
end
of
it
all
and
i
didn't

him
on
the
tv
preachin'
'bout
the
promised
lands
he
tells
me
to
believe
in
jesus
and
steals
the
money
from
my
hands
some
say
he
was
a
good
man
but
lord
i
think
he
sinned
yeah
twenty-two
years
of
mental
tears
cries
a
suicidal
vietnam
vet
who
fought
a
losing
war
on
a
foreign
shore
to
find
his
country
didn't
want
him
back
their
bullets
took
his
best
friend
in
saigon
our
lawyers
took
his
wife
and
kids
no
regrets
in
a
time
i
don't
remember
in
a
war
he
can't
forget
he
cried
&quot;forgive
me
for
what
i've
done
there
cause
i
never
meant
the
things
i
did&quot;
[chorus:]
and
give
me
something
to
believe
in
if
there's
a
lord
above
and
give
me
something
to
believe
in
oh
lord
arise
my
best
friend
died
a
lonely
man
in
some
palm
springs
hotel
room
i
got
the
call
last
christmas
eve
and
they
told
me
the
news
i
tried
all
night
not
to
break
down
and
cry
as
the
tears
rolled
down
my
face
i
felt
so
cold
and
empty
like
a
lost
soul
out
of
place
and
the
mirror
mirror
on
the
wall
sees
my
smile
it
fades
again
[chorus]
sometimes
i
wish
to
god
i
didn't
know
now
the
things
i
didn't
know
then
road
you
gotta
take
me
home
i
drive
by
the
homeless
sleeping
on
a
cold
dark
street
like
bodies
in
an
open
grave
underneath
the
broken
old
neon
sign
that
used
to
read
jesus
saves
a
mile
away
live
the
rich
folks
and
i
see
how
they're
living
it
up
while
the
poor
they
eat
from
hand
to
mouth
the
rich
is
drinking
from
a
golden
cup
and
it
just
makes
me
wonder
why
so
many
lose
so
few
win
[chorus]
you
take
the
high
road
and
i'll
take
the
low
road
sometimes
i
wish
to
god
i
didn't
know
now
the
things
i
didn't
know
then
and
give
me
something
to
believe
in
the
world
was
on
fire
and
no
one
could
save
me
but
you
it's
strange
what
desire
will
make
foolish
people
do

never
dreamed

i
looked
out
across
the
river
today
i
saw
a
city
in
the
fog
and
an
old
church
tower
where
the
seagulls
play
i
saw
the
sad
shire
horses
walking
home
in
the
sodium
light
i
saw
two
priests
on
the
ferry
october
geese
on
a
cold
winter's
night
and
all
this
time
the
river
flowed
endlessly
to
the
sea
two
priests
came
round
our
house
tonight
one
young
one
old
to
offer
prayers
for
the
dying
to
serve
the
final
rite
one
to
learn
one
to
teach
which
way
the
cold
wind
blows
fussing
and
flapping
in
priestly
black
like
a
murder
of
crows
and
all
this
time
the
river
flowed
endlessly
to
the
sea
if
i
had
my
way
i'd
take
a
boat
from
the
river
and
i'd
bury
the
old
man
i'd
bury
him
at
sea
blessed
are
the
poor
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
better
to
be
poor
than
a
fat
man
in
the
eye
of
a
needle
and
as
these
words
were
spoken
i
swore
i
hear
the
old
man
laughing
'what
good
is
a
used
up
world
and
how
could
it
be
worth
having'
and
all
this
time
the
river
flowed
endlessly
like
a
silent
tear
and
all
this
time
the
river
flowed
father
if
jesus
exists
then
how
come
he
never
lived
here
the
teachers
told
us
the
romans
built
this
place
they
built
a
wall
and
a
temple
an
edge
of
the
empire
garrison
town
they
lived
and
they
died
they
prayed
to
their
gods
but
the
stone
gods
did
not
make
a
sound
and
their
empire
crumbled
'til
all
that
was
left
were
the
stones
the
workmen
found
and
all
this
time
the
river
flowed
in
the
falling
light
of
a
northern
sun
if
i
had
my
way
i'd
take
a
boat
from
the

do
not
make
the
man
all
we
have
to
do
now
is
take
these
lies
and
make
them
true

all
we
have
to
see
is
that
i
don't
belong
to
you
and
you
don't
belong
to
me

will
not
give

to
give
what
you
take
well
it
looks
like
the
road
to
heaven
but
it
feels
like
the
road
to
hell
when
i
knew
which
side
my
bread
was
buttered
i
took
the
knife
as
well
posing
for
another
picture

got
to
sell
but
when
you
shake
your
ass

notice
fast
and
some
mistakes
were
built
to
last

what
you

what
you
get

what
you
get
for
changing
your
mind

feel
you
breathe
your
love
so
deep
inside
of
me
if
the
moon
and
stars
should
fall
they'd
be
easy
to
replace
i
would
lift
you
up
to
heaven
and
you
would
take
their
place
then
i
saw
red
when
i
opened
up
the
door
i
saw
red
my
heart
just
spilled
onto
the
floor
and
i
didn't
need
to
see
his
face
i
saw
yours
i
saw
red
when
i
closed
the
door
i
don't
think
i'm
gonna
love
you
anymore
everyday
i
wake
up
i
thank
god
that
you
are
still
a
part
of
me
we've
opened
up
the
door
to
which
so
many
people
never
find
the
key
and
if
the
sun
should
ever
fail
to
send
its
light
we
would
burn
a
thousand
candles
and
make
everything
alright
then
i
saw
red
when
i
opened
up
the
door
i
saw
red
my
heart
just
spilled
onto
the
floor
and
i
didn't
need
to
see
his
face
i
saw
yours
i
saw
red
when
i
closed
the
door
i
don't
think
i'm
gonna
love
you
anymore
i've
been
hurt
and
i've
been
blind
i'm
not
sure
that
i'll
be
fine
i
never
thought
it
would
end
this
way
oo
it
must
be
magic
so
this
is
love
or
so
you
tell
me
as
you're
walkin
out
the
door
the
months
go
by
and
i
know
for
certain
it's
not
the
love
i'm
looking
for
but
sometimes
just
for
a
moment
i
reach
out
hope
you're
still
there
miles
away
no
you're
never
turning
back
and
i
just
can't
wait
anymore
miles
away
nothing
left
of
what
we
had
just
when
i
needed
you
most
you
were
miles
away
it's
hard
to
tell
what
you're
going
through
you
kept
your
feelings
locked
inside
of
you
open
your
heart
and
chances
are
what
you're
feeling
i'm
feeling
too
if
only
just
for
a
moment
hold
on
to
the
dreams
that
we
had
miles
away
no
you're
never
turning
back
and
i
just
can't
wait
anymore
miles
away
nothing
left
of
what
we
had
just
when
i
needed
you
most
you
were
miles
away
when
times
were
tough
and
you
were
down
and
out
who
was
there
by
your
side
but
now
you're
gone
and
i'm
so
tired
of
being
alone
with
only
your
promises
the
loneliness
just
fades
away
thoughts
of
you
just
memories
no
cryin
out
for
what
you're
missing
time
won't
forget
what
you
meant
to
me
if
only
just
for
a
moment
hold
on
to
the
dreams
that
we
had...
you
said
it
loud
and
i
heard
you
never
tried
to
hurt
you
some
say
i'm
old-fashioned
i
like
to
take
my
time
and
do
it
slow
you
know
with
the
flow
but
don't
try
to
rush
it
so
ride
it
like
a
horse
and
let
nature
take
its
course
get
to
know
each
other
be
my
friend
not
just
my
lover
share
your
thoughts
with
me
love
my
mind
not
just
my
body
baby
[chorus]

you
really
want
me
baby
let
me
know
cuz
if
you
really
like
me

me

no
time
for
silly
games

may
be
the
kind
of
guy
you

please

the
way
i
feel
i
must
have
trust
or

no
deal

emotion's
ain't
to
be
played
with
or
given
free
i
appreciate
greatly
the
way

toleratered
me

wouldn't
blame
you
if
you
hate
me

put
up
with
my
butt
