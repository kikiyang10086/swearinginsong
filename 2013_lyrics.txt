'cause
your
shine
is
somethin'
like
a
mirror
and
i
can't
help
but
notice
you
reflect
in
this
heart
of
mine
if
you
ever
feel
alone
and
the
glare
makes
me
hard

just
know
that
i'm
always
parallel

with
your

in
my

full
of
soul
i
can
tell
you
there's
no

we
couldn't
go
just
put
your

on
the

pull
you
through
you
just

i
don't
wanna
lose
you

now
you

you
somethin'
an
original
'cause
it
doesn't
seem
merely
a
sample
and
i
can't
help

stare
'cause
i
see
truth
somewhere
in
your
eyes
i
can't
ever
change
without
you
you
reflect
me
i
love
that
about
you
and
if
i
could
i
would
look
at
us
all
the

stole
my
heart
and
i
your
willing
victim
i
let
you
see
the
parts
of
me
that
weren't
all
that
pretty
and
with
every
touch
you
fixed
them
now
you've
been
talking
in
your
sleep
oh

to
me
oh
oh

me
that
you've
had
enough
of
our
love
our
love
just
give
me
a
reason
just
a
little
bit's
enough
just
a
second
we're
not
broken
just
bent
and
we
can
learn
to
love
again
it's
in
the
stars
it's
been
written
in
the
scars
on
our
hearts
we're

broken
just
bent
and
we
can

head
is
running
wild
again
my

love
love
just
give
me
a

fix
it
for
us
we're
collecting
dust

stars
it's
been
written
in
the
scars
on
our
hearts
that
we're
not

feels
just
a
little
bit
bigger
now
our
song
on
the
radio
but
it
don't
sound
the
same
when
our
friends
talk
about
you
all
it
does
is
just
tear
me
down
'cause
my
heart
breaks
a
little
when
i
hear
your
name
it
all
just
sounds
like
ooooohxe2x80xa6
mmm
too
young
too
dumb
to
realize
that
i
should've
bought
you
flowers
and
held
your
hand
should've
gave
you
all
my
hours
when
i
had
the
chance
take
you
to
every
party
'cause
all
you
wanted
to
do
was
dance
now
my
baby's
dancing
but
she's
dancing
with
another
man
my
pride
my
ego
my
needs
and
my
selfish
ways
caused
a
good
strong
woman
like
you
to
walk
out
my
life
now
i'll
never
never
get
to
clean
up
the
mess
i
made
ohhxe2x80xa6
and
it
haunts
me
every
time
i
close
my
eyes
it
all
just
sounds
like
ooooohxe2x80xa6
mmm
too
young
too
dumb
to
realize
that
i
should've

probably
much
too
late
to
try
and
apologize
for
my
mistakes
but
i
just
want
you
to
know
i
hope
he
buys
you
flowers

you
all
his
hours
when
he
has
the

take
you

there
was
a
time
i
used
to
look
into
my
father's
eyes.
in
a
happy
home
i
was
a
king
i
had
a
golden
throne.
those
days
are
gone
now
the
memory's
on
the
wall.
i
hear
the
songs
from
the
places
where
i
was
born.
upon
a
hill
across
a
blue
lake
that's
where
i
had
my
first
heartbreak.
i
still
remember
how
it
all
changed.
my
father
said
&quot;don't
you
worry
don't
you
worry
child.
see
heaven's
got
a

yeah
there
was
a
time
i
met
a
girl
of
a
different
kind.
we
ruled
the
world
i
thought
i'd
never
lose
her
out
of
sight.
we
were
so
young
i
think
of
her
now
and
then.
i
still
hear
the
songs
reminding
me
of
a
friend.
upon
a
hill
across
a
blue
lake
that's
where
i
had
my
first
heartbreak.
i
still
remember

hard
'cause
i

when
the
sun
comes
up
i
will
leave
this
is
my
last
glance
that
will
soon
be
a
memory

tethered
mind
freed
from
the
lies
and
i'll
kneel
down
wait

kneel
down
know
my
ground
raise

ever
wonder
about
what
he's
doing
how
it
all
turned
to
lies
sometimes
i
think
that
it's
better
to
never
ask
why
where
there
is
desire
there
is
gonna
be
a
flame
where
there
is
a
flame
someone's
bound
to
get
burned
but
just
because
it
burns
doesn't
mean
you're
gonna
die
you've
gotta

eh
eh
eh
funny
how
the
heart
can
be
deceiving
more
than
just
a
couple
times
why
do
we
fall
in
love
so
easy
even
when
it's
not
right
where
there
is
desire
there
is

and
the
cards
all
fold
and
the
saints
we

are
all
made
of
gold
when
your
dreams
all
fail
and
the
ones
we
hail
are
the
worst
of
all
and
the
blood's
run
stale
i
wanna
hide
the
truth
i
wanna
shelter
you
but
with
the
beast
inside
there's
nowhere
we

it's
the
last
of
all
when
the
lights
fade
out
all
the
sinners
crawl
so
they
dug
your
grave
and
the
masquerade
will
come
calling
out
at
the
mess
you've
made

well
i
woke
up
to
the
sound
of
silence
and
cries
were
cutting
like
knives
in
a
fist
fight
and
i
found
you
with
a
bottle
of
wine
your
head
in
the
curtains
and
heart
like
the
fourth
of
july
you
swore
and
said
&quot;we
are
not
we
are
not
shining
stars.&quot;
this
i
know
i
never
said
we
are
though
i've
never
been
through
hell
like
that
i've
closed
enough
windows
to
know
you
can
never
look
back
if
you're
lost
and
alone
or
you're
sinking
like
a
stone.
carry
on.
may
your
past
be
the
sound
of
your
feet
upon
the
ground.
carry
on.
carry
on
carry
on
so
i
met
up
with
some
friends
at
the
edge
of
the
night
at
a
bar
off
75.
and
we
talked
and
talked
about
how
our
parents
will
die
all
our
neighbours
and
wives.
but
i
like
to
think
i
can
cheat
it
all
to
make
up
for
the
times
i've
been
cheated
on.
and
it's
nice
to
know
when
i
was
left
for
dead
i
was
found
and
now
i
don't
roam
these
streets
i
am
not
the
ghost
you
are
to
me.
if
you're
lost
and
alone
or
you're
sinking
like
a
stone.
carry
on.
may
your
past
be
the
sound
of
your
feet
upon
the
ground.
carry
on.
whoa
my
head
is
on
fire
but
my
legs
are
fine.
after
all
they
are
mine.
lay
your
clothes
down
on
the
floor
close
the
door
hold
the
phones
show
me
how
no
onexe2x80x99s
ever
gonna
stop
us
now.
'cause
we
are
we
are
shining
stars
we
are
invincible
we
are
who
we
are
on
our
darkest
day
when
wexe2x80x99re
miles
away
so
we'll
come
we
will
find
our
way
home
if
you're
lost
and
alone
or
you're
sinking
like
a
stone.
carry
on.
may
your
past
be
the
sound
of
your
feet
upon
the
ground.
carry
on.
oooh.
oooh.
oooh.
oooh.
no
one's

gonna
stop
us
now

now
bet
your
window's
rolled
down
and
your
hair's
pulled
back
and
i
bet
you
got
no
idea
you're
going
way
too
fast
you're
trying
not
to
think
about
what
went
wrong
trying
not
to
stop
'til
you
get
where
you
goin'
you're
trying
to
stay
awake
so
i
bet
you
turn
on
the
radio
and
the
song
goes
i
can't
live
without
you
i
can't
live
without
you
baby
i
can't
live
without
you
i
can't
live
without
you
baby
baby
the
highway
won't
hold
you
tonight
the
highway
don't
know
you're
alive
the
highway
don't
care
if
you're
all
alone
but
i
do
i
do.
