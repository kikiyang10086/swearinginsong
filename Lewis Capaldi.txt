kinda
liked
the
way
you
numbed
all
the
pain


now
the
day
bleeds
into
nightfall
and
you're
not

meet
has
grown
too
much
for
me
to
block
it
out
i
miss
the

of
your
heartbeat
it's
such
a
warming

i

you're
finding
the
power
to
help
you
make
it
through
the
darker
days
for
now
i
wait
by
the
hour
if
you
wanna
take
somebody’s
breath
away

hope
you’re
lonely
hope

tried
to
hold
on

where
do
you
go
when
love
it
just
ain't
enough
now
does
it
kill
you
when
you
think
about
me
are
you
as
close
to
giving
up
as
i've
been
i
know
we
kept
losing
touch
got
lost
in
the
rush
i
pray
you
don't
hurt
too
much


i
don’t
come
close
to
an
angel
you
ain’t
never
been
no
kind
of
saint
but
when
we
both
came
together
hell
to
heaven
you
were
my
escape
but
fires
don't
burn
forever
and
all
these
ashes
crumble
when
we
touch
we
danced
to
death
in
the
fire
what
can
we
do
now
that
the

done

lyrics
every
little
part
of
me
is
holding
on
to
every
little
piece
of
you
is
holding
on
to
every
drop
of
blood
you
drew
is
holding
onto
you
and
every
waking
hour
i
spend
holding
out
for
reasons
not
to
go
to
bed
i'm
holding
out
for
someone
else
to
hold
instead
if
every
hope
of
you
is
dead


'cause
every
night
since
you
cut
and
run
i
feel
like
the
only
one
who's
ever
been
the
lonely
one
trying
to
mend
a
heart
that
keeps
breaking
with
every
step
that
you're
taking


'cause
you've
been
running
circles
'round
my
mind
turning
me
inside
out
and
i
fell
for
you
but
hit
the
ground
'cause
the
only
love
i've
known
has
let
me
down

i
need
lifting
up
now
you
ain't
here
i'm
sleeping
rough
and
i'm
praying
i
can
pray
enough
so
waking
up
without
you
ain’t
so
tough


find
it
hard
to
find
my
feet
when
i
keep
on
stumbling
over
you
and
me
but
i
keep
on
trying
'cause
i
know
i
need
to
outrun
the
memories
you
might
also
like
and
every
day
i'm
reminded
of
the
way
i
let
it
come
undone
i
feel
like
the
lonely
one
the
only
one
with
time
worth
wasting
well
i
still
can't
stop
chasing


'cause
you've
been
running

lyrics
where'd
you
get
to
where'd
you
go
i've
been
so
lost
since
you
left
wish
you
kept
leading
me
on
tried
to
reach
ya
tried
to
call
i
bang
my
head
against
your
door
but
there
ain't
nobody
home


and
if
you
want
to
stay
lost
awhile
i'll
rearrange
the
road
i
take
and
meet
you
out
in
the
wild
and
if
you
want
we
can
wait
behind
we
can
find
a
place
to
hide
maybe
i
could
change
your
mind


so
i'm
holding
out
for
something
more
let
me
hold
your
rolling
heart
of
stone
weigh
down
heavy
like
you
did
before
let
me
hold
your
rolling
heart
of
stone
let
it
roll
let
it
roll
let
it
roll
again
let
it
roll
let
it
roll
let
me
hold
your
heart
of
stone


if
you
think
you
might
feel
the
same
i'll
be
right
here
where
we
left
off
same
old
story
same
old
place
i
won't
wander
i
won't
let
go
'cause
there's
more
life
in
my
bones
than
you
give
me
credit
for
you
might
also
like
and
if
you
want
to
stay
lost
awhile
i'll
rearrange
the
road
i
take
and
meet
you
out
in

wild
and
if
you

lyrics
i've
been
feeling
every
second
since
she
told
me
we
were
through
been
going
hell
for
leather
'cause
there's
fuck
all
else
to
do
and
she
stumbled
through
some
problems
said
"you're
the
only
wrong
in
me"
but
i've
been
missing
something
bring
your
body
home
to
me


am
i
wasting
my
time
oh
i'm
tryna
find
any
truth
in
between
the
lies
am
i
wasting
my
time
replaying
conversations
running
'round
in
my
mind


didn't
wanna
be
a
love
let
go
barely
getting
by
on
my
own
guess
i'll
always
be
holding
on
to
something
borrowed
didn't
wanna
sing
myself
away
for
long
nights
into
wasted
days
saying
her
name
like
something
borrowed


i'm
only
getting
older
feeling
sorry
for
myself
been
wondering
who
she's
holding
is
playing
havoc
with
my
health
you
might
also
like
am
i
wasting
my
time
oh
i'm
tryna
find
any
truth
in
between
the
lies
am
i
wasting
my
time
replaying

your
love
when
i'm
talking
too

tough
with
your
love
you've
got
