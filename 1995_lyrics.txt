[in
the
backgoround
while
singing
chorus]
oh
once
upon
a
midnight
dreary
i
woke
with
something
in
my
head
i
couldn't
escape
the
memory
of
a
phone
call
and
of
what
you
said
like
a
game
show
contestant
with
a
parting
gift
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
when
i
saw
through
the
voice
of
a
trusted
friend
who
needs
to
humor
me
and
tell
me
lies
yeah
humor
me
and
tell
me
lies
and
i'll
lie
too
and
say
i
don't
mind
and
as
we
seek
so
shall
we
find
and
when
you're
feeling
open
i'll
still
be
here
but
not
without
a
certain
degree
of
fear
of
what
will
be
with
you
and
me
i
still
can
see
things
hopefully
but
you
why
you
wanna
give
me
a
run-around
is
it
a
sure-fire
way
to
speed
things
up
when
all
it
does
is
slow
me
down
and
shake
me
and
my
confidence
about
a
great
many
things
but
i've
been
there
i
can
see
it
cower
like
a
nervous
magician
waiting
in
the
wings
of
a
bad
play
where
the
heroes
are
right
and
nobody
thinks
or
expects
too
much
and
hollywood's
calling
for
the
movie
rights
singing
hey
babe
let's
keep
in
touch
hey
baby
let's
keep
in
touch
but
i
want
more
than
a
touch
i
want
you
to
reach
me
and
show
me
all
the
things
no
one
else
can
see
so
what
you
feel
becomes
mine
as
well
and
soon
if
we're
lucky
we'd
be
unable
to
tell
what's
yours
and
mine
the
fishing's
fine
and
it
doesn't
have
to
rhyme
so
don't
you
feed
me
a
line
but
you
why
you
wanna
give
me
a
run-around
is
it
a
sure-fire
way
to
speed
things
up
when
all
it
does
is
slow
me
down
tra
la
la
la
la
bombardier
this
is
the
pilot
speaking
and
i've
got
some
news
for
you
it
seems
my
ship
still
stands
no
matter
what
you
drop
and
there
ain't
a
whole
lot
that
you
can
do
oh
sure
the
banner
may
be
torn
and
the
wind's
gotten
colder
perhaps
i've
grown
a
little
cynical
but
i
know
no
matter
what
the
waitress
brings
i
shall
drink
it
and
always
be
full
yeah
i
will
drink
it
and
always
be
full
oh
i
like
coffee
and
i
like
tea
i'd
like
to
be
able
to
enter
a
final
plea
i
still
got
this
dream
that
you
just
can't
shake
i
love
you
to
the
point
you
can
no
longer
take
well
all
right
okay
so
be
that
way
i
hope
and
pray
that
there's
something
left
to
say...
for
you
now
why
you
wanna
give
me
a
run-around
is
it
a
sure-fire
way
to
speed
things
up
when
all
it
does
is
slow
me
down
oh
yeah
now
why
you
wanna
give
me
a
run-around
is
it
a
sure-fire
way
to
speed
things
up
when
all
it
does
is
slow
me
down
they
read
you
cinderella

this
romeo
is
bleeding
but
you
can't
see
his
blood
it's
nothing
but
some
feelings
that
this
old
dog
kicked
up
it's
been
raining
since
you
left
me
now
i'm
drowning
in
the
flood
you
see
i've
always
been
a
fighter
but
without
you
i
give
up
now
i
can't
sing
a
love
song
like
the
way
it's
meant
to
be
well
i
guess
i'm
not
that
good
anymore
but

just
me

i
will
love
you

i'll
be
there
'til
the
stars
don't
shine
'til
the
heavens
burst
and
the
words
don't
rhyme
and
i
know
when
i
die
you'll
be
on
my
mind
and
i'll
love
you
always
now
your
pictures
that
you
left
behind
are
just
memories
of
a
different
life
some
that
made
us
laugh
some
that
made
us
cry
one
that
made
you
have
to
say
goodbye
what
i'd
give
to
run
my
fingers
through
your
hair
to
touch
your
lips
to
hold
you
near
when
you
say
your
prayers
try
to
understand
i've
made
mistakes
i'm
just
a
man
when
he
holds
you
close
when
he
pulls
you
near
when
he
says
the
words
you've
been
needing
to
hear
i'll
wish
i
was
him
'cause
those
words
are
mine
to
say
to
you
'til
the
end
of
time
and
i
will
love
you
baby
always
and
i'll
be
there
forever
and
a
day
always
if
you
told
me
to
cry
for
you
i
could
if
you
told
me
to
die
for
you
i
would
take
a
look
at
my
face
there's
no
price
i
won't
pay
to
say
these
words
to
you
well
there
ain't
no
luck
in
these
loaded
dice
but
baby
if
you
give
me
just
one
more
try
we
can
pack
up
our
old
dreams
and
our
old
lives
we'll
find
a
place
where
the
sun
still
shines
and
i
will
love
you
baby
always
and
i'll
be
there
forever

when
i
die
you'll
be
on
my
mind
and
i'll
love
you
always
listen
as
your
day
unfolds
challenge
what
the
future
holds

walk
blindly
to
the
light
and

out
for
his
hand
don't
ask
any
questions
and
don't
try
to
understand
open
up
your
mind
and
then
open
up
your
heart
and
you
will
see
that
you
and
me
aren't
very
far
apart
'cause
i
believe
that
love
is
the
answer
i
believe
that
love
will
find
the
way
violence
is
spread
worldwide
and
there
are
families
on
the
street
and
we
sell
drugs
to
children
now
oh
why
can't
we
just
see
that
all
we
do
is
eliminate
our
future
with
the
things
we
do
today
money
is
our
incentive
now
so
that
makes
it
okay
but
i
believe
that
love
is
the
answer
i
believe
that
love
will
find
the
way
i
believe
that
love
is
the
answer
i
believe
that
love
will
find
the
way
i've
been
seeing
lisa
now
for
a
little
over
a
year
she
said
she's
never
been
so
happy
but
lisa
lives
in
fear
that
one
day
daddy's
gonna
find
out
she's
in
love
with
a
nigger
from
the
streets
oh
how
he
would
lose
it
then
but
she's
still
here
with
me
'cause
she
believes
that
love
will
see
it
through
and
one
day
he'll
understand
and
he'll
see
me
as
a
person
not
just
a
black
man
'cause
i
believe
that
love
is
the
answer
i
believe
that
love
will
find
the
way
i
believe
i
believe
i
believe
i
believe

and

if

you
that

throwing
punches
in
the
air
when

you
think
i'm
an
ignorant
savage
and
you've
been
so
many
places
i
guess
it
must
be
so
but
still
i
can
not
see
if
the
savage
one
is
me
how
can
there
be
so
much
that
you
don't
know
you
don't
know
you
think
you
own
whatever
land
you
land
on
the
earth
is
just
a
dead
thing
you
can
claim
but
i
know
every
rock
and
tree
and
creature
has
a
life
has
a
spirit
has
a
name
you
think
the
only
people
who
are
people
are
the
people
who
look
and
think
like
you
but
if
you
walk
the
footsteps
of
a
stranger
you'll
learn
things
you
never
knew
you
never
knew
have
you
ever
heard
the
wolf
cry
to
the
blue
corn
moon
or
asked
the
grinning
bobcat
why
he
grinned
can
you
sing
with
all
the
voices
of
the
mountains
can
you
paint
with
all
the
colors
of
the
wind
can
you
paint
with
all
the
colors
of
the
wind
come
run
the
hidden
pine
trails
of
the
forest
come
taste
the
sun
sweet
berries
of
the
earth
come
roll
in
all
the
riches
all
around
you
and
for
once
never
wonder
what
they're
worth
the
rainstorm
and
the
river
are
my
brothers
the
heron
and
the
otter
are
my
friends
and
we
are
all
connected
to
each
other
in
a
circle
in
a
hoop
that
never
ends
how
high
does
the
sycamore
grow
if
you
cut
it
down
then
you'll
never
know
and
you'll
never
hear
the
wolf
cry
to
the
blue
corn
moon
for
whether
we
are
white
or
copper-skinned
we
need
to
sing
with
all
the
voices
of
the

need
to
paint
with
all
the

you
can
own
the
earth
and
still
all
you'll
own
is
earth
until
you
can
paint
with
all
the
colors

you're
by
my

everything
is

an

i

a

my

right
now
you
decide
that
you
are

to
settle
down

if
you
want
my

then
it's

that
you
start
to
act
like
you're
mine
in
the

say
things

i've
already
heard
don't
want
your
body
without
your

it
felt
like
spring
time
on
this
february
morning
in
a
courtyard
birds
were
singing
your
praise
i'm
still
recalling
things
you
said
to
make
me
feel
alright
i
carried
them
with
me
today
now
as
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
this
i
pray
that
you
will
hold
me
dear
though
i'm
far
away
i'll
whisper
your
name
into
the
sky
and
i
will
wake
up
happy
i
wonder
why
i
feel
so
high
though
i
am
not
above
the
sorrow
heavy
hearted
till
you
call
my
name
and
it
sounds
like
church
bells
or
the
whistle
of
a
train
on
a
summer
evening
i'll
run
to
meet
you
barefoot
barely
breathing
as
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
ooh
la
kah
koh
this
i
pray
that
you
will
hold
me
dear
though
i'm
far
away
i'll
whisper
your
name
into
the
sky
ooh
la
kah
koh
and
i
will
wake
up
happy
oh
darling
as
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
ooh
la
kah
koh
this
i
pray
that
you
will

away
i'll
whisper
your
name
into
the
sky
ooh
la
kah
koh
and
i
will
wake
up
happy
it's
not
too
near
for
me
like
a
flower
i
need
the
rain
though
it's
not
clear
to
me
every
season
has
it's
change
and
i
will
see
you
when
the
sun
comes
out
again
as
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
ooh

will

wonder
why

baby
lately
i've
been
thinking
something's
going
wrong
'cause
you
got
an
attitude
and
you're
not
in
the
mood
like
you
used
to
girl
i
can
feel
it
when
i
hold
you
in
my
arms
the
feeling
is
not
the
same
can
i
be
the
one
to
blame
i
don't
wanna
lose
your
love
mmm
i
don't
wanna
say
bye-bye
oh
no
no
true
love
is
so
hard
to
find
and
it's
right
between
your
lips
and
mine
and
mine
turn
the
lights
down
low
let's
take
it
nice
and
slow
my
mission
is
to
keep
you
mine
don't
want
this
to
be
the
last
time
we
make
sweet
love
baby
i
know
you
feel
it
too
it's
bigger
than
the
both
of
us
there's
one
thing
i'm
so
certain
of
it's
always
the
little
things
i
remember
and
i
can't
just
let
it
slip
away
slip
away
teddy
won't
you
play
the
music
for
me
teddy
won't
you
play
backstreet
side
baby
i
get
so
lonely
sometimes
i...
baby
my
heart
is
broken
sometimes
i
need
you
right
now
i
don't...
i
can't
let
you
slip
away
slip
away
i
don't
see
it
being
a
problem
if
i
just
get
one
little
bitty
kiss
baby...
i
just
can't
let
you
get
away
oh
yeah...
lord

mercy...
i
don't
want
lose
your
sweet
love
so
don't
say
good-bye
say
good-night
i
would
like
to
get
to
know
if
i
could
be
the
kind
of
girl
that
you
could
be
down
for
'cause
when
i
look
at
you
i
feel
something
tell
me
that
you're
the
kind
of
guy
that
i
should
make
a
move
on
and
if
i
don't
let
you
know
then
i
won't
be
for
real
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
feel
like
something
could
be
going
on
the
more
i
see
you
the
more
that
it
becomes
so

a
rabbit
in
a
hat
with
a
bat
and
a
six
four
impala
i
wish
i
was
like
six-foot-nine
so
i
can
get
with
leoshi
'cause
she
don't
know

really
fine
you
know
i
see
her
all
the
time
everywhere
i
go
and
even
in
my
dreams
i
can
scheme
of
ways
to
make
her
mine
'cause
i
know
she's
livin'

basketball
i'm
always
last
to
be
picked
and
in
some
cases
never
picked
at
all
so
i
just
lean
up
on
the
wall
or
sit
up
in
the
bleachers
with
the
rest
of
the

their
man

a
bottle
and
put
in
a
hospital
for
talkin'

confess
it's
a
shame
when
you

in
a
city
that's
the
size
of
a
box
and
nobody
knows
yo'

came
to
my
senses

sick-sick

i've
walked
these
streets
a
virtual
stage
it
seemed
to
me
make
up
on
their
faces
actors
took
their
places
next
to
me
i've
walked
these
streets
in
a
carnival
of
sights
to
see
all
the
cheap
thrill
seekers
the
vendors
&amp;
the
dealers
they
crowded
around
me
have
i
been
blind
have
i
been
lost
inside
myself
and
my
own
mind
hypnotized
mesmerized
by
what
my
eyes
have
seen
i've
walked
these
streets
in
a
spectacle
of
wealth
&amp;
poverty
in
the
diamond
market
the
scarlet
welcome
carpet
that
they
just
rolled
out
for
me
i've
walked
these
streets
in
the
mad
house
asylum
they
can
be
where
a
wild
eyed
misfit
prophet
on
a
traffic
island
stopped
and
he
raved
of
saving
me
have
i
been

have
i
been
lost
inside
myself

my

mesmerized
by
what
my
eyes
have
seen
have
i
been
wrong
have
i
been
wise
to
shut
my
eyes
and
play
along
hypnotized
paralyzed
by
what
my
eyes
have
found
by
what
my
eyes
have
seen
what
they
have
seen

i

i
been
hypnotized
mesmerized
by
what
my
eyes
have
found
in
that
great
street
carnival
in
that
carnival
i
guess
now
it's
time
for
me
to
give
up
i
feel
it's
time
got
a
picture
of
you
beside
me
got
your
lipstick
mark
still
on
your
coffee
cup
got
a
fist
of
pure
emotion
got
a
head
of
shattered
dreams
gotta
leave
it
gotta
leave
it
all
behind
now
whatever
i
said
whatever
i
did
i
didn't
mean
it
i
just
want
you
back
for
good
whenever
i'm
wrong
just
tell
me
the
song
and
i'll
sing
it
you'll
be
right
and
understood
unaware
but
underlined
i
figured
out
this
story
it
wasn't
good
but
in
the
corner
of
my
mind
i
celebrated
glory
but
that
was
not
to
be
in
the
twist
of
separation
you
excelled
at
being
free
can't
you
find
a
little
room
inside
for
me
whatever
i
said
whatever
i
did
i
didn't
mean
it
i
just
want
you
back
for
good
whenever
i'm
wrong
just
tell
me
the
song
and
i'll
sing
it
you'll
be
right
and
understood
and
we'll
be
together
this
time
is
forever
we'll
be
fighting
and
forever
we
will
be
so
complete
in
our
love
we
will
never
be
uncovered
again
whatever
i
said
whatever
i
did
i
didn't
mean
it
i

burn
down
to
his

you
never

to
fall
you're
really
on
your
knees
when
you
think
you're
standing
tall

are
&quot;know-it-alls&quot;
and

played
that
fool
for
you

cried
there
were
nights
that
died
for
you

tried
and
i
tried
to
deny
that
your
love
drove
me
crazy
baby
if
the
love
that
i
got
for
you
is
gone

we
got
away
with
the
perfect
crime

we
were
just
a

that
i
was
blind
remember
those
nights
dancing
at
the
masquerade
the
clowns
wore
smiles
that
wouldn't
fade
you
and
i
were
the
renegades
some
things
never
change
it
made
me
so
mad
'cause
i
wanted
it
bad
for
us
baby
now
it's
so
sad

whatever
we
had
ain't
worth
saving

the
love
that
i
got
for
you
is

rolls
listen
now
you
can
hear
our
heart
beat
warm
against
life's
bitter
cold...
these
are
the
days
the
sweetest
days
we'll

there

times
that
scare
me
that
rattle
the
house
like
wind
both
of
us
so
unbending
we
battle
the
fear
within
all
the
while
life
is
rushing
by
us
hold
it
now
and
don't
let
go
these
are
the
days
the
sweetest
days
we'll
know
so
we
whisper
a
dream
here
in
the
darkness
watching
the
stars
til
they're
gone
and
when
even
the
memories
have
all
faded
away
these
days
go
on
and
on
listen
now
you
can
hear
our
heartbeat
hold
me
now
and
don't
let
go
these
are
the
days
every
day
is
the
sweetest
day
we'll
know
the

know
brokenhearted
ooh-yeah
ooh
yeah-yeah
yeah
yeah
oh-whoa
oh
oh-oh
i'm
young
but
i'm
wise
enough
to
know
that
you
don't
fall
in
love
overnight
oh
yeah
that's
why
i
thought
if
i
took
my
time
that
everything
in
love
would
be
right
but
as
soon
as
i
closed
my
eyes
i
was
saying
to
love
&quot;goodbye&quot;
but
i
guess
i'm
only
brokenhearted
life's
not
over
i
can
start
again
while
i'm
lonely
brokenhearted
it's
a
hurting
thing
to
get
over
no
more
empty
conversations
next
time
i
will
be
totally
sure
oh
yeah
don't
want
the
pain
of
falling
in
and
out
of
love
it's
more
than
my
poor
heart
should
endure
ooh-oh
so
i'll
listen
to
all
advice
and
remember
each
time
i
cry
that
i
guess
i'm
only
brokenhearted

brokenhearted
life's
