me

the
sunlight
dance
across
your
face
and
i've
never
been
this
swept
away
all
my
thoughts
just
seem
to
settle
on
the
breeze
when
i'm
lying
wrapped
up
in
your
arms
the
whole
world
just
fades
away
the
only
thing
i
hear
is
the
beating
of
your
heart
and
i
can
feel
you
breathe
it's
washing
over
me
and
suddenly
i'm
melting
into
you
there's
nothing
left
to
prove
baby
all
we
need
is
just
to
be
caught
up
in
the
touch
slow
and
steady
rush
baby
isn't
that
the
way
that
love's
supposed
to
be
i
can
feel
you
breathe

breathe
in
a
way
i
know
my
heart
is
waking
up
as
all
the
walls
come
tumbling
down
i'm
closer
than
i've
ever
felt
before

know
there's
no
need
for
words
right

be
more
into
him
instead
of
worryin'
about
me
and
hopefully
you
won't
find
all
of
the
reasons

place
with
golden
streets

would
like
our
world
to
change
it
helps
me
to
appreciate
those
nights
and
those
dreams
but
my
friend
i'd
sacrifice
all
those
nights
if
i
could
make
the
earth
and
my
dreams
the
same
the
only
difference
is
to
let
love
replace
all
our
hate
so

go
there
let's
make
our
escape

there
let's
ask
can
we

the
very
first
time

many
days
in

she
woke
up
with
hope

she
only
found
tears
and
i
can
be
so
insincere
making
her
promises
never
for
real
as
long
as
she
stands
there
waiting
wearing
the
holes
in

days
disappear

you
look

how
do
you
choose
your
clothes
never
wear
as
well
the
next
day
and
your
hair
never
falls
in

fire
in
your

give
up
all
i

never
been
now

only
want
to
be
right

it
was
love
at
first
sight
i
know
from
the
way
she
looked
at
me
her
eyes
said
it
all
long
days
and
nights
we've
spent
until
she
dropped
the
bomb
on
me
when
she
said
that
she
was
unhappily
married
with
children
and
i
wish
i
never
met
her
at
all
even
though
i
love
her
so
she
got
love
from
me
but
she
still
belongs
to
someone
else
it
hurts
so
bad
for
sure
because
she
wants
to
be
with
me
but
she
cannot
be
with
me
she
chose
to
stay
at
home
so
they
could
be
a
family
for
the
children
but
what
about
me
and
i
wish
i
never
met
her
at
all
even
though
i
love
her
so
she
got
love
from
me
but
she
still
belongs
to
someone
else
maybe
in
another
life
things
could
be
the
way
we
both
desired
it's
a
catch-22
either
way
it
hurts
someone
that
you
lose
and
i
wish
i
never
met
her
at
all
even
though
i
love
her
so
she
got
love
from

i
never
met
her
at
all
i
wouldn't
hurt
so
much
inside
oh

get
something

couldn't
we

i
could
be
better
friends
don't
you
think
it's
time
we
went
a
bit
further
oh
yeah
every
night
when
we
say
goodbye
how
can
i
help
looking
in
your
eyes
wondering
why
you
and
i
haven't
hit
it
can
we
get
it
on
[chorus:]
kind
of
faded
but
i
feel
alright
thinkin'
about
making
my
move
tonight
i
can't
pretend
that
you're
only
my
friend
when
you're
holdin'
my
body
tight
'cause
i
like
the
way
you're
making
your
move
i
like
the
way
you're
making
me
wait
at
the
end
of
the
night
when
i
make
up
your
mind
you'll
be
coming
on
home
with
me
yeah
yeah
yeah
don't
you
know
you've
got
it
and
you
know
i
want
it
i
can't
wait
to
take
you
home
you
know
you've
got
it
tonight
i
don't
want
to
be
rude
at
all
i
just
want
to
be
where
you
go
think
what
we
could
do
alone
yeah
couldn't
we
do
what
we
did
last
night
again
baby
you
and
i
could
be
better
friends
don't
you
think
it's
time
we
went
a
bit
further
oh
yeah
every
night
when
we
say
goodbye
how
can
i
help
lookin'
in
your
eyes
wondering
why
you
and
i
haven't
hit
it
can
we
get
it
on
[rap:]
when
we
first
met
yo
that
deal
was
stated
you
spent
like
my
d's
the
way
we
compensated;
just
another
day
around
the
way
with
me
up
close
so
every
thing
ok.
'cause
i'm
not
like
the
rest
indecision
with
the
best
plus
for
my
full
court
press
because
they
hated-
how's
it
go
hah-
yo
faded.
[chorus
x5]
i've
been
sittin
here
tryin
to
find
myself
i
get
behind
myself
i
need
to
rewind
myself
lookin
for
the
payback
listen
for
the
playback
they
say
that
every
man
bleeds
just
like
me
and
i
feel
like
number
one
yet
i'm
last
in
line
i
watch
my
youngest
son
and
it
helps
to
pass
the
time
i
take
too
many
pills
it
helps
to
ease
the
pain
i
made
a
couple
of
dollar
bills
but
still
i
feel
the
same
everybody
knows
my
name
they
say
it
way
out
loud
a
lot
of
folks
fuck
with
me
it's
hard
to
hang
out
in
crowds
i
guess
that's
the
price
you
pay
to
be
some
big
shot

knocks
me
down

way
it
is
you
gotta
roll
with
the
punches
oh
and
that's
the
way
it
goes
you
gotta
bend
when
the
wind
blows
you
live
you
learn
you
crash
you
burn
it's
hit
or
miss
and
that's
the
way
it
is
one
fine
day
you
wake
up
completely
hopelessly
fallen
in
love
he's
just
what
you're
looking
for
the
only
problem
is
that
the
man's
not
sure
another
guy
will
give
you
everything
the
only
problem
is
you
don't
feel
a
thing
well
i
know
from
experience
nothing's
ever
gonna
make
perfect
sense
oh
one
day
you
get
what
you
want
but
it's
not
what
you
think
then
you
get
what
you
need
[chorus]
yea
they
say
your
soul
is
growing
but
sometimes
i
feel
like
throwing
something
and
that's
they
way
it
is
you
gotta
roll
with
the
punches
and
that's
they
way
it
goes
you

she
moved
into
my
old
apartment
that's
how
we
got
this
whole
thing
started
she
called
and
said
that
i
had
mail
waiting
there
for
me
i
told
her
that
i'd
come
and
get
it
how
could
i
know
in
just
a
minute
that
i'd
be
standing
face
to
face
with
my
own
destiny
oh
and
we
sat
there
talkin'
just
like
we
were
old
friends
oh
then
i
ask
her
can
i
see
you
again
she
said
yes
and
i
said
wow
she
said
when
and
i
said
how
about
right
now
love
can't
wait
then
i
asked
if
she
believed
in
fate
and
she
said
yes
the
days
flew
by
like
a
fast
train
nothin'
else
has
been
on
my
brain
except
the
thought
of
how
she
makes
me
the
man
i
want
to
be
she's
the
one
i
want
for
a
million
reasons
and
loving
her
is
just
like
breathin'
it's
easy
and
it's
obvious
she
was
made
for
me
oh
then
it
happened
one
night
lookin'
in
her
eyes
oh
when
i
popped
the
question
much
to
my
surprise
she
said
yes
and
i
said
wow
she
said
when
and
i
said
how
about
right
now
love
can't
wait
then
i
asked
if
she
believed
in
fate
and
she
said
yes
so
i
called
the
preacher
family
and
friends
and
nothin's
been
the
same
since
she
said
yes
and
i
said
wow
she
said
when
i
said
how
about
right
now
love
can't
wait
then
i
asked
if
she
believed
in
fate
and
she
said
yes
she
said
yes
we
loaded
up
my
old
station

with
a

some
fishin'
poles

i'd
rather
be
alone
she
doesn't
fully
understand
me
that
i'd
rather
leave
than
to
cheat
if
she
gives
me
some
time
i
can
be
the
man
she
needs
but
there's
a
lot
of
lust
inside
of
me
and
we've
been
together
since
our
teenage
years
i
really
don't

ever
thought
it
could
possibly
be
it's
perfect
it's
passion

setting
me
free
from
all
of
my
sadness
the
tears

cried

me
never
found
a
sacred
place
lost
in
your
embrace
i
want
to
stay
in
this
forever

empty
heart
