hard
you
try

that
in

[chester

all
i

[mike

time
is
a
valuable

watch
it
count
down
to
the

the

go
right
out
the

trying
to
hold
on

didn't
even
know
i
wasted
it
all
just
to
watch
you
go
[chester

watch
you
go
[mike

i
kept
everything
inside
and
even
though
i
tried
it
all
fell
apart
what
it
meant
to
me

of
the

your

remembering
all
the

you
fought
with

i'm

it
got
so
far
[chester

things
aren't
the

that
you

for
the
lucky
fact
of
your

i
would
climb
the
andes
solely

the

my

me
is
still
hiding
up
my
sleeve
they
love
to
tell
you
stay
inside
the
lines
but
something's
better
on
the
other
side
i
wanna
run
through
the
halls
of
my
high
school
i
wanna
scream
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
i
just
found
out
there's
no
such
thing
as
the
real
world
just
a
lie
you've
got
to
rise
above
so
the
good
boys
and
girls
take
the
so
called
right
track
faded
white
hats
grabbing
credits
and
maybe
transfers
they
read
all
the
books
but
they
can't
find
the
answers
and
all
of
our
parents
they're
getting
older
i
wonder
if
they've
wished
for
anything
better
while
in
their
memories
tiny
tragedies
they
love
to
tell
you
stay
inside
the
lines
but
something's
better
on
the
other
side
i
wanna
run
through
the
halls
of
my
high
school
i

i
just

such
thing
as
the
real
world
just
a
lie
you've
got
to
rise
above
i
am
invincible
i
am
invincible
i
am
invincible
as
long
as
i'm
alive
i
wanna
run
through
the
halls
of
my
high
school
i

i
just
can't

yo
yo
have
you
ever
been
hated
or
discriminated
against
i
have;
i've
been
protested
and
demonstrated
against
picket
signs
for
my
wicked
rhymes
look
at
the
times
sick
as
the
mind
of
the
motherfucking
kid
that's
behind
all
this
commotion
emotions
run
deep
as
oceans
exploding
tempers
flaring
from
parents
just
blow
'em
off
and
keep
going
not
taking
nothing
from
no
one
give
'em
hell
long
as
i'm
breathing
keep
kicking
ass
in
the
morning
and
taking
names
in
the
evening
leave
'em
with
a
taste
as
sour
as
vinegar
in
they
mouth
see
they
can
trigger
me
but
they'll
never
figure
me
out
look
at
me
now;
i
bet
you're
probably
sick
of
me
now
ain't
you
mama
i'mma
make
you
look
so
ridiculous
now
i'm
sorry
mama
i
never
meant
to
hurt
you
i
never
meant
to
make
you
cry;
but
tonight
i'm
cleaning
out
my
closet
one
more
time
i
said
i'm
sorry
mama
i
never
meant
to
hurt
you
i
never
meant
to
make
you
cry
but
tonight
i'm
cleaning
out
my
closet
ha
i
got
some
skeletons
in
my
closet
and
i
don't
know
if
no
one
knows
it
so
before
they
throw
me
inside
my
coffin
and
close
it
i'mma
expose
it;
i'll
take
you
back
to
'73
before
i
ever
had
a
multi-platinum-selling
cd
i
was
a
baby
maybe
i
was
just
a
couple
of
months
my
faggot
father
must
have
had
his
panties
up
in
a
bunch
'cause
he
split
i
wonder
if
he
even
kissed
me
goodbye
no
i
don't.
on
second
thought
i
just
fucking
wished
he
would
die
i
look
at
hailie
and
i
couldn't
picture
leaving
her
side
even
if
i
hated
kim
i'd
grit
my
teeth
and
i'd
try
to
make
it
work
with
her
at
least
for
hailie's
sake
i
maybe
made
some
mistakes
but
i'm
only
human
but
i'm
man
enough
to
face
them
today
what
i
did
was
stupid
no
doubt
it
was
dumb
but
the
smartest
shit
i
did
was
take
them
bullets
outta
that
gun
'cause
i'da
killed
him;
shit
i
would've
shot
kim
and
him
both
it's
my
life
i'd
like
to
welcome
y'all
to
&quot;the
eminem
show&quot;
i'm
sorry
mama
i
never
meant
to
hurt
you
i
never
meant
to
make
you
cry;
but
tonight
i'm
cleaning
out
my
closet
one
more
time
i
said
i'm
sorry
mama
i
never
meant
to
hurt
you
i
never
meant
to
make
you
cry
but
tonight
i'm
cleaning
out
my
closet
now
i
would
never
diss
my
own
mama
just
to
get
recognition
take
a
second
to
listen
'fore
you
think
this
record
is
dissing
but
put
yourself
in
my
position;
just
try
to
envision
witnessing
your
mama
popping
prescription
pills
in
the
kitchen
bitching
that
someone's
always
going
through
her
purse
and
shit's
missing
going
through
public
housing
systems
victim
of
mxc3xbcnchausen's
syndrome
my
whole
life
i
was
made
to
believe
i
was
sick
when
i
wasn't
'til
i
grew
up
now
i
blew
up
it
makes
you
sick
to
your
stomach
doesn't
it
wasn't
it
the
reason
you
made
that
cd
for
me
ma
so
you
could
try
to
justify
the
way
you
treated
me
ma
but
guess
what
you're
getting
older
now
and
it's
cold
when
you're
lonely
and
nathan's
growing
up
so
quick
he's
gonna
know
that
you're
phony
and
hailie's
getting
so
big
now;
you
should
see
her
she's
beautiful
but
you'll
never
see
her
she
won't
even
be
at
your
funeral
see
what
hurts
me
the
most
is
you
won't
admit
you
was
wrong
bitch
do
your
song
keep
telling
yourself
that
you
was
a
mom
but
how
dare
you
try
to
take
what
you
didn't
help
me
to
get
you
selfish
bitch;
i
hope
you
fucking
burn
in
hell
for
this
shit
remember
when
ronnie
died
and
you
said
you
wished
it
was
me
well
guess
what
i
am
dead
dead
to
you
as
can
be
i'm
sorry
mama
i
never
meant
to
hurt
you
i
never
meant
to
make
you
cry;
but
tonight

your

tonight
you

arms
underneath
the
starlight
starlight
we'll
be
lost
in
the
rhythm
so
right
feel

steal
your
heart
tonight
you
can
try
to
resist

you're
never
gonna

underneath
the
starlight
starlight
there's
a
magical
feeling
so
right
it
will
steal
your
heart
tonight
you
can
try
to

from
my

my
love
here's
how
it
goes
you
and
me
up
and
down
but
maybe
this
time
we'll
get
it
right
worth
the
fight
'cause
love
is
something
you
can't
shake
when
it
breaks
when
it
breaks
all
it
takes
is
some
trying
if
you
feel
like
leaving
i'm
not
gonna
beg
you
to
stay
but

escape
my
love
you
can
run
you
can
hide
but
you
can't
escape
my
love
so
if
you
go
you
should
know
you
should
know
it's
hard
to
just
forget
the
past
so
fast
it
was
good
it
was
good
it
was
bad

he
looks
calm
and

to
drop
bombs

he
keeps
on
forgetting
what
he
wrote
down

goes
so
loud
he
opens
his
mouth
but
the
words
won't
come
out
he's
choking
how
everybody's
joking

don't
matter
he's
dope
he
knows
that
but
he's
broke
he's
so
stagnant
he
knows
when
he
goes
back
to
this
mobile
home
that's
when
it's
back
to
the
lab

there's
a
thousand
words
that
i
could
say
to
make
you
come
home
oh
seems
so
long
ago
you
walked
away
left
me
alone
i
remember
what
you
said
to
me
you
were
acting
so
strange
and
maybe
i
was
too
blind
to
see
that
you
needed
a
change
was
it
something
i
said
to
make
you
turn
away
to
make
you
walk
out
and
leave
me
cold
if
i
could
just
find
a
way
to
make
it
so
that
you
were
right
here
but
right
now..
i've
been
sitting
here
can't
get
you
off
my
mind
i've
tried
my
best
to
be
a
man
and
be
strong
i've
drove
myself
insane
wishing
i
could
touch
your
face
but
the
truth
remains..
you're
gone..
you're
gone..

don't

won't
change
the
fact
that
you're
gone

if
there's
something
that
i
could
do
won't
you
please
let
me
know
the
time
is
passing
so
slowly
now
guess
that's
my
life
without
you
and
maybe
i
could
change
my
every
day
but
baby
i
don't
want
to
so
i'll
just
hang
around
and
find
some
things
to
do
to
take
my
mind
off
missing
you
and

know
in

seemed
right
so
i
pulled
up
not

around

the
old
bar
keep
down
at
the

the
whiskey

didn't
pour
me
a
beer
his
blue
eyes
kinda
went
misty
he
said:
&quot;you

that
here
'cause
it's
the
first
long
kiss
on
a
second

all
worried
when
you
get
home
late

droppin'
the
ring
in
the
spaghetti
plate
'cause
your
hands
are
shakin'

the
way
that
she

the
rice
in
her
hair
eatin'
burnt
suppers
the
whole
first

askin'
for
seconds
to
keep
her
from
tearin'
up

good
stuff&quot;
he
grabbed
a
carton
of
milk
an'
he
poured
a
glass
an'
i
smiled

was
18
feet
from
the
bow
to
stern
light
secondhand
from
a
dealer
in
atlanta
i
rode
up
with
daddy
when
he
went
there
to
get
her
we
put
on
a
shine
put
on
a
motor
built
out
of
love
and
made
for
the
water
ran
her
for
years
til'
the
transom
got
rotten
a
piece
of
my
childhood
will
never
be
forgoten
it
was
just
an
old
plywood
boat
with
a
75
johnson
with
electric
choke
a
young
boy
two
hands
on
the
wheel
i
can't
replace
the
way
it
made
me
feel
and
i
would
turn
her
sharp
and
i
would
make
it
whine
he'd
say
&quot;you
can't
beat
the
way
a
old
wood
boat
rides&quot;
just
a
little
lake
cross
the
alabama
line
but
i
was
king
of
the
ocean
when
daddy
let
me
drive
just
an
old
half
ton
short
bed
ford
my
uncle
bought
new
in
64
daddy
got
it
right
cause
the
engine
was
smoking
a
couple
of
burnt
valves
and
he
had
it
going
he'd
let
me
drive
her
when
we
haul
off
a
load
down
a
dirt
strip
where
we'd
dump
trash
off
of
thigpen
road
i'd
sit
up
in
the
seat
and
stretch
my
feet
out
to
the
pedels
smiling
like
a
hero
who
just
received
his
medal
it
was
just
an
old
hand
me
down
ford
with
3
speed
on
the
column
and
a
dent
in
the
door
a
young
boy
two
hands
on
the
wheel
i
can't
replace
the
way
it
made
me
feel
and
i
would
press
that
clutch
and
i
would
keep
it
right
he
would
say
a
little
slower
son
your
doing
just
fine
just
a
dirt
road
with
trash
on
each
side
but
i
was
mario
andretti
when
daddy
let
me
drive
i'm
grown
up
now
3
daughters
of
my
own
i
let
them
drive
my
old
jeep
across
the
pasture
at
our
home
maybe
one
day
they'll
reach
back
in
their
file
and
pull
out
that
old
memory
and
think
of
me
and
smile
and
say
it
was
just
an
old
worn
out
jeep
rusty
old
floor
boards
hot
on
my
feet
a
young
girl
two
hands
on
the
wheel
i
can't
replace
the
way
it
made
me
feel
and
he'd
say
turn
it
left
and
steer
it
right
straighten
up
girl
now
you're
doing
just
fine
just
a
little
valley
by
the
river
where
we'd
ride
but
i
was
high
on
a
mountain
when
daddy
let
me
drive
daddy
let
me
drive
oh
he
let
me
drive
it's
just
an
old
plywood
boat
with
a
75
johnson
and
electric
choke
cutting
through
the
darkest
night
are
my
two
headlights
trying
to
keep
it
clear
but
i'm
losing
it
here
to
the
twilight
there's
a
dead
end
to
my
left
there's
a
burning
bush
to
my
right
you
aren't
in
sight
you
aren't
in
sight
do
you
want
me
like
i
want
you
or
am
i
standing
still
beneath
the

sky
or
am
i
standing
still
with
the
scenery
flying
by
or
am
i
standing
still
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
was
that
you
passing
me
by
mothers
on
the
stoop
boys
in
souped-up
coupes
on
this
hot
summer
night
between
fight
and
flight
is
the
blind
man's
sight
and
a
choice
that's
right
i
roll
the
window
down
feel
like
i'm
i'm
gonna
drown
in
this
strange
town
feel
broken
down
i
feel
broken
down
do
you
need
me

a

routine
i
liked
a
blue
ocean
view
free
to
go
with
the
flow
anywhere
that
i
wanted
to
but
the
moment
you
set
foot
on
my
shore
that's
when
i
knew
there's
a
difference
in
living
and
living
well
you
can't
have
it
all
all
by

you

it
with

'til
you
sailed
with
me
thought
that
i
had
it
good
as
good
as
it
could
be
from
the
back
of
my
deck
caught
a
fish
caught
a
breeze
and
a
thousand
red
sunsets
but
sitting
here
with
you
girl
i
just
saw
the
best
one
yet
there's
a
difference
in
living
and
living
well
you
can't
have
it
all
all
by

there's

my
days
are
brighter
my
sky
a
deeper
blue
my
nights
are
sweeter
when
i'm
with
you
there's
a
difference

you
can't

there's
a
difference
in
living
and
living
well
under
an
old
brass
paperweight
is
my
list
of
things
to
do
today
go
to
the
bank
and
the
hardware
store
put
a
new
lock
on
the
cellar
door
i
cross
'em
off
as
i
get
'em
done
but
when
the
sun
is
set
there's
still
more
than
a
few
things
left
i
haven't
got
to
yet
go
for
a
walk
say
a
little
prayer
take
a
deep
breath
of
mountain
air
put
on
my
glove
and
play
some
catch
it's
time
that
i
make
time
for
that
wade
the
shore
and
cast
a
line
look
up
a
long
lost
friend
of
mine
sit
on
the
porch
and
give
my
girl
a
kiss
start
livin'
that's
the
next
thing
on
my
list
wouldn't
change
the
course
of
fate
but
cuttin'
the
grass
just
had
to
wait
'cause
i've
got
more
important
things
like
pushin'
my
kid
on
the
backyard
swing
i
won't
break
my
back
for
a
million
bucks
i
can't
take
to
my
grave
so
why
put
off
for
tomorrow
what
i
could
get
done
today
like
go
for
a
walk
say
a
little
prayer
take
a
deep
breath
of
mountain
air
put
on
my
glove
and
play
some
catch
it's

start
livin'
that's
the
next
thing
on
my
list
raise
a
little
hell
laugh
'til
it
hurts
put
an
extra
five
in
the
plate
at
church
call
up
my
folks
just
to
chat
it's
time
that
i
make
time
for
that
stay
up
late
then
oversleep
show
her
what
she
means
to
me
catch
up
on
all
the
things
i've
always
missed
just
start
livin'
that's
the
next
thing
on
my
list
under
an
old
brass
paperweight
is
my
list
of
things
to
do
today
if
it
weren't
for
your
maturity
none
of
this
would
have
happened
if
you
weren't
so
wise
beyond
your
years
i
would've
been
able
to
control
myself
if
it
weren't
for
my
attention
you
wouldn't
have
been
successful
and
if
if
it
weren't
for
me
you
would
never
have
amounted
to
very
much
ooh
this
could
be
messy
but
you
don't
seem
to
mind
and
ooh
don't
go
telling
everybody
and
overlook
this
supposed
crime
we'll
fast
forward
to
a
few
years
later
and
no
one
knows
except
the
both
of
us
and
i
have
honored
your
request
for
silence
and
you've
washed
your
hands
clean
of
this
you're
essentially
an
employee
and
i
like
you
having
to
depend
on
me
you're
a
kind
of
protxc3xa9gxc3xa9
and
one
day
you'll
say
you
learned
all
you
know
from
me
and
and
i
know
you
depend
on
me
like
a
young
thing
would
to
a
guardian
i
know
you
sexualize
me
like
a
young
thing
would
and
i
think
i
like
ya
ooh
this
could
get
messy
but
ooh
you
don't
seem
to
mind
dude

go
telling
everybody
and

this
supposed
crime

a
few

i've
more
than
honored
your
request
for
silence
and
you've
washed
your
hands
clean
of
this
what
part
of
our
history's
reinvented
and
under
rug
swept
what
part
of
your
memory
is
selective
and
tends
to
forget
what
with
this
distance
it
seems
so
obvious
just
make
sure
you
don't
tell
on
me
especially
to
members
of
your
family
we
best
keep
this
to
ourselves
and
not
tell
any
members
of
our
inner
posse
i
wish
i
could
tell
the
world
'cause
you're
such
a
pretty
thing
when
you're
done
up
properly
i
might
wanna
marry
you
one
day
if
you
watch
that
weight
and
keep
your
firm
body
ooh
this
could
be
messy
and
ooh
i
don't
seem
to
mind

don't
go

was
a

she
was
a
girl.

he
was
a
punk.
she
did
ballet.

more
can
i
say
he
wanted
her.
she'd
never

secretly
she
wanted
him
as
well.
and
all
of
her
friends
stuck
up
their
nose.
they
had
a
problem
with
his
baggy
clothes.
he
was
a
skater
boy.
she
said
&quot;see
ya
later

he
wasn't
good
enough
for
her.
she
had
a
pretty
face
but
her
head
was
up
in
space.
she
needed
to
come
back
down
to
earth.
five
years
from
now
she
sits
at
home
feeding
the
baby.
she's
all
alone.
she
turns
on
tv
and
guess
who
she
sees
skater
boy
rockin'
up
mtv.
she
calls
up
her
friends.
they
already
know.
and
they've
all
got
tickets
to
see
his
show.
she
tags
along
stands
in
the
crowd
looks
up
at
the
man
that
she
turned
down.
he
was
a
skater
boy.
she
said
&quot;see
ya
later
boy.&quot;

wasn't

enough
for
her.

are
more
than
just
good
friends.
this
is
how
the
story
ends.
too
bad
that
you
couldn't
see...
see
the
man
that
boy
could
be.
there
is
more
than
meets
the
eye
i
see
the
soul
that
is
inside.
he's
just
a
boy
and
i'm
just
a
girl.

sky
did
