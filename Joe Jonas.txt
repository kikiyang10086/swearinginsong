the
questions
why
nowhere
to
be
found

the
fog
so
i'm
trapped
in
this
lighthouse

my
heart
is
gettin'
cold
as
i
count
the
days
i
would
give
my
soul
for
the
chance
to
see
her

all
i
see
are

for
you
to
save
me
from
drownin'

a
thousand

will
make
a

from
me
you’ll

and
it's
mighty
clear
that
i'm
not

a
song
about
that
point
of
relationship
when
you're
just
frustrated
and
you're
like

i-i'm
totally
reminded
of
this
person
that
i
don't
want
to
be
reminded
of

when
you-when
you
hit
that
breaking
point
even
a
piece
of
clothing
or
a
place
that
you
go
and
eat
reminds
you
of
that
person
and

physically
just
don't
want
