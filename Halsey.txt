found
you
when
your
heart
was
broke
i
filled
your
cup
until
it
overflowed
took
it
so
far
to
keep
you
close

i
was
afraid
to
leave
you
on
your
own



i
said
i'd
catch
you
if
you
fall

and
if
they
laugh
then
fuck
'em
all

and
then
i
got
you
off
your
knees
put
you
right
back
on
your
feet
just
so
you
could
take
advantage
of
me

me

your
little
brother
never
tells
you
but
he
loves
you
so
you
said
your
mother
only
smiled
on
her
tv
show
you're
only
happy
when
your
sorry
head
is
filled
with
dope
i'll
hope
you
make
it
to
the
day
you're
28
years
old


you're
drippin'
like
a
saturated
sunrise
you're
spilling
like
an
overflowin'
sink
you're
ripped
at
every
edge
but
you're
a
masterpiece
and
now
you're
tearin'
through
the
pages
and
the
ink


everything
is
blue
his
pills
his
hands
his
jeans
and
now
i'm
covered
in
the
colors
pulled
apart
at
the
seams
and
it's
blue
and
it's
blue
everything
is
gray
his
hair
his
smoke
his
dreams
and
now
he's
so
devoid
of
color
he
don't
know
what
it
means
and
he's
blue
and
he's
blue
you
might
also
like
you
were
a
vision
in
the
morning
when
the
light
came
through
i
know
i've
only
felt
religion
when
i've
lied
with
you
he
said
"you'll
never
be
forgiven
'til
your
boys
are
too"
and
i'm
still
waking
every
morning
but
it's
not
with
you


you're

punched
it
to
shatters
collected
the

picked
out
a
dagger
i've
pinched
my
skin
in
between
my
two
fingers

wished
i
could
cut
some

i've
missed
your
calls
for
months
it
seems
don't
realize
how
mean
i
can
be
'cause
i
can
sometimes
treat
the
people
that
i
love
like

'cause
i

try
you
on
but
i
still
know
your
birthday
and
your
mother's
favorite
song


so
i'm
sorry
to
my

sorry
that
i
can't

anybody
ever
really

ooh
oooh


i
run
away
when
things
are
good

never
really
understood
the
way
you
laid
your
eyes
on
me
in
ways
that
no
one
ever
could
and
so
it
seems
i
broke
your
heart
my
ignorance
has
struck
again
i
failed
to
see
it
from
the
start
and
tore
you
open
'til
the
end
you
might
also

i'm
sorry
to
my

lyrics
your

so
crisp
so
green
sour
apple
baby
but
you
taste
so
sweet
you
got
hips like jagger

two left
feet

i
wonder
if
you'd like

meet
your
voice
is
velvet
through
a
telephone
you
can
come
to
mine

both
my
roommates
are
home
think
i
know
a
bar
where
they
would
leave
us
alone
and
i
wonder
if
you'd
take
it
slow


oh
we're
dancin'
in
my
living
room
and
up
come
my
fists
and
i
say
i'm
only
playing
but
the
truth
is
this
that
i've
never
seen
a
mouth
that
i
would
kill
to
kiss
and
i'm
terrified
but
i
can't
resist
and
i
said


beautiful
stranger
here
you
are
in
my
arms
and
i
know
that
beautiful
strangers
only
come
along
to
do
me
wrong
and
i
hope
beautiful
stranger
here
you
are
in
my
arms
but
i
think
it's
finally
finally
finally
finally
finally
safe
for
me
to
fall


oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh
you
might
also
like
i
grab
your
hand
and
then
we
run
to
the
car
singing
in
the
street
and
playing
air
guitar
stuck
between
my
teeth
just
like
a
candy
bar

i
wonder
if
it
goes
too
far
to
say
i've
never
recognized
a
purer
face
you
stopped
me
in
my
tracks
and
put
me
right
in
my
place
used
to
think
that
loving
meant
a
painful
chase
but
you're
right
here
now
and
i
think
you'll
stay


oh
we're
dancin'
in
my
living
room
and
up
come
my
fists
and
i
say
i'm
only
playing
but
the
truth
is
this
i've
never
seen
a
mouth
that
i
would
kill
to
kiss
and
i'm
terrified
but
the
truth
is
this
i
said


beautiful
stranger
here
you
are
in
my
arms
and
i
know
that
beautiful
strangers
only
come
along
to
do
me
wrong
and
i
hope
beautiful
stranger
here
you
are
in
my

it's

innocent
i
don't

no

fresh
want
them
wearing

let

sad

bad
guys
mouth
full
of
white
lies
kiss
me
in
the
corridor
but
quick
to
tell
me
goodbye


you
say
that
you're
no

i'm

never-sleep-alone
boy
got
a
million
numbers
and
they're
filling
up
your
phone
boy
i'm
off
the
deep
end
sleeping
all
night
through
the
weekend
saying
that
i
love
him
but
i
know
i'm
gonna
leave
him
you

i'd
like
to
tell
you
that
my
sky's
not
blue
it's
violent
rain
and
in
my world the
people
on the
street
don't
know
my
name
in my
world
i'm
seven
feet
tall
and
the
boys
always
call
and
the
girls
do
too
because
in
my
world
i'm
constantly
constantly
havin'
a
breakthrough

or
a
breakdown
or
a
blackout
would
you
make
out
with
me
underneath
the
shelter
of
the
balcony


'cause
i
don't
need
anyone
i
don't
need
anyone
i
just
need
everyone

some

i

i
just
need
everyone
and
then
some


wish
i
could
see
what
it's
like
to
be
the
blood
in
my
veins
do
the
insides
of
all
of
my
fingers
still
look
the
same
and
can
you
feel
it
too
when
i
am
touchin'
you
and
when
my
hair
stands
on
ends
it's
saluting
you
the
blush
in
your
cheeks
says
that
you
bleed
like
me
and
the
808
beat
sends
your
heart
to
your
feet
left
my
shoes
in
the
street
so
you'd
carry
me
through
a
breakdown
through
a
breakdown
or
a
blackout
would
you
make
out
with
me
on
the
floor
of
the

i
don't

and
then
some


my
face
is
full
of
spiderwebs
all
tender
yellow
blue
and
still
with
one
eye
open
well
all
i
see
is
you
i
left
my
daydreams
at
the
gate
because
i
just
can't
take
'em
too
know
my
heart
still
has
a
suitcase
but
i
still
can't
take
it
through


i
don't
