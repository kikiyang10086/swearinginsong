lyrics


my
lover's
got
humor
she's
the
giggle
at
a
funeral
knows
everybody's
disapproval
i
should've
worshipped
her
sooner
if
the
heavens
ever
did
speak
she's
the
last
true
mouthpiece
every
sunday's
getting
more
bleak
a
fresh
poison
each
week
"we
were
born
sick"
you
heard
them
say
it
my
church
offers
no
absolutes
she
tells
me
"worship
in
the
bedroom"
the
only
heaven
i'll
be
sent
to
is
when
i'm
alone
with
you
i
was
born
sick
but
i
love
it

me
to
be
well

the
shrine
of
your
lies

tell
you
my
sins
and

babe
there's
something
tragic
about
you
something

lonesome

that
the
kinda
way
to
face
the
burning

i
just

about
my

i'm
so
full
of
love
i
could
barely

there's
nothin'
sweeter
than
my

i'd
never
want
once
from
the
cherry

'cause
my
baby's
sweet
as
can
be
she
give
me
toothaches
just
from
kissin'
me

boys
when
my

found
me
i
was
three
days
on
a
drunken
sin
i
woke
with
her
walls
around
me
nothin'
in
her
room
but
an
empty
crib
and
i
was
burning
up
a
fever
i
didn't
care
much
how
long
i
lived
but
i
swear
i
thought
i
dreamed
her
she
never
asked
me
once
about
the
wrong
i
did

might

my
babe
would
never
fret
none
about
what
my
hands
and
my
body
done
if
the
lord
don't
forgive
me
i'd
still
have
my
baby
and
my
babe
would
have
me
when
i
was
kissin'
on
my
baby
and
she'd
put
her
love
down
soft
and
sweet
in
the
low
lamplight
i
was
free
heaven
and
hell
were
words
to
me

my

it's
not

the

singing

fled
to

so
much
discounted
ah

i'm
flying
like
a
bird
to
you
now
back
to
the
hedgerows
where
bodies
are
mounted
ah
but
i'm
flying
like

you
now
you
might
also
like
i
was
housed
by
your
warmth

transformed

your
grounded

moment’s
silence

lyrics
when
stunted
hand
earns
place
with
man
by
mere
monstrosity
alarms
are
struck
and
shore
is
shook
by
sheer
atrocity
a
cure
i
know
that
soothes
the
soul
does
so
impossibly
a
moment's
silence
when
my
baby
puts
the
mouth
on
me
and
my
babe
relax
and
catch
the
manic
rhapsody
all
reason
flown
as
god
looks
on
in
abject
apathy
a
squall
and
all
of
me
is
a
prayer
in
perfect
piety
a
moment's
silence
when
my
baby
puts
the
mouth
on
me


when
the
meaning
is
gone
there
is
clarity
and
the
reason
comes
on
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me

and
it's
easy
done
our
little
remedy
and
the
reason
comes
on
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me


what
yields
the
need
for
those
who
lead
us
oh
so
morally
those
that
would
view
the
same
we
do
through
their
deformity
who
view
the
deed
as
power's
creed
as
pure
authority
this
moment's
silence
when
my
baby
puts
the
mouth
on
me
you
might
also
like
since
it
all
begun
to
it's
reckoning
there
the
reason
comes
on
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me
be
thankful
some
know
it
lovingly
there
the
reason
comes
in
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me


like
a
heathen
clung
to
the
homily
let
the
reason
come
on
the
common
tongue
of
your
loving
me
so
summon
on
the
pearl
rosary

come

i
watch
the
work
of
my
kin
bold
and
boyful
toying
somewhere
between
love
and
abuse
calling
to
join
them
the
wretched

joyful
shaking
the
wings
of
their
terrible
youths
freshly
disowned
in
some
frozen
devotion
no
more
alone
or
myself
could
i
be
lurched
like
a
stray
to
the
arms
that
were
open
no
shortage
of
sordid
no
protest
from
me


with
her
sweetened
breath

down
with
the
rest
at
her
feet
fresh
from
the
fields

the

of

you're
movin'
without

when

all

never

when
i
was
a
child
i
heard
voices
some
would
sing
and
some
would
scream
you
soon
find
you
have
few
choices
i
learned
the
voices
died
with
me
when
i
was
a
child
i'd
sit
for
hours
staring
into
open
flame
something
in
it
had
a
power
could
barely
tear
my
eyes
away


all
you
have
is
your
fire
and
the
place
you
need
to
reach
don't
you
ever
tame
your
demons
but
always
keep
them
on
a
leash




when
i
was
sixteen
my
senses
fooled
me
thought
gasoline
was
on
my
clothes
i
knew
that
something
would
always
rule
me
i
knew
this
scent
was
mine
alone
you
might
also

you
have

your
fire
and

you
need
to
reach
don't
you
ever
tame
your
demons
always
keep
them
on
a
leash


when
i
was
a
man
i
thought
it
ended
when
i
knew
love's
perfect
ache
but
my
peace
has
always
depended
on
all
the
ashes
in
my
wake

you
have

i

never
known
peace

the
damp
grass
that
yields
to
me
i
have
never
known
hunger
like
these
insects
that
feast
on
me


a
thousand
teeth
and
yours
among
them
i
know
our
hungers
appeased
our
heartbeats
becoming
slow


we'll
lay
here

thrown

me

have
never

colour

this
morning
reveals
to
me
you
might
also
like
and
you
haven't
moved
an
inch
such
that
i
would
not
know
if
you
sleep
always
like
this
the
flesh
calmly
going
cold


we'll
lay
here
for
years
or
for
hours
your
hand
in
my
hand
so
still
and
discreet
so
long
we'd
become
the
flowers
we'd
feed
well
the

the
sheep

up
dinner
and
diatribes
i
knew
well
from
our
first
hookup
the
look
of
mischief
in
your
eyes
your
friends
are
a
fate
that
befell
me
hell
is
the
talking
type
i'd
suffer
hell
if
you’d
tell
me
what
you'd
do
to
me
tonight


tell
me
tell
me
tell
me
ah


that's
the
kind
of
love
i’ve
been
dreaming
of
that's
the
kind
of
love
i've
been
dreaming
of


honey
i
laugh
when
it
sinks
in
a
pillar
i
am
upright
scarcely
can
speak
for
my
thinking
what
you'd
do
to
me
tonight
now
that
the
evening
is
slowing
now
that
the
end's
in
sight
honey
it's
easier
knowing
what
you'd
do
to
me
tonight
you
might
also
like
tell
me
tell
me
tell
your
man


that's
the
kind
of
love
i’ve
been
dreaming
of
that’s
the
kind
of
love
i've
been
dreaming
of



oh
let
there
be
hotel
complaints
and
grievances
raised
and
that
kind
of
love

oh
let
there
be
damage
ensued
and
tabloid
news
and
that
kind
of
love

that's
the
kind
of
love
i've
been
dreaming
of
ah
oh-oh-oh
ah

that's
the
kind
of
love
i've
been
dreaming
of
and
