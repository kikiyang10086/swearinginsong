lyrics


for
all
the
times
that
you
rained
on
my
parade
and
all
the
clubs
you
get
in
using
my
name
you
think
you
broke
my
heart
oh
girl
for
goodness
sake
you
think
i'm
cryin'
on
my
own
well
i
ain't


and
i
didn't
wanna
write
a
song
'cause
i
didn't
want
anyone
thinking
i
still
care
i
don't
but
you
still
hit
my
phone
up
and
baby
i'll
be
movin'
on
and
i
think
you
should
be
somethin'
i
don't
wanna
hold
back
maybe
you
should
know
that

my
mama
don't
like
you
and
she
likes
everyone
and
i
never
like
to
admit
that
i
was
wrong
and
i've
been
so
caught
up
in
my
job
didn't
see
what's
going
on
but
now
i
know
i'm
better
sleeping
on

own


'cause
if
you
like
the
way
you
look

and
every
time
you
told
me
my
opinion
was
wrong

to
make
me
