him
tonight
i’ll
see
you
in
the
mornin'
no
of
course
he
won't
drink
and
drive
can
you
say
bye
to
mom
for
me
oh
you’ll
like
him
he's
really
kind
and
he's
funny
like
you
sometimes
and
i
found
someone
i
really
like
maybe
for
the
first
time


no
i
don't
need
a
jacket
it's
not
that
cold
tonight
and
you
worry
i
get
it
but
he's
waitin'
outside


i
swear
on
my
heart
that
he's
a
good
man
i
know
you’ll
stay
up
late
just
waitin’
for
me
you
held
me
so
tight
now
someone
else
can

you
were
the

man
that
really
loved
me


now
you're
driving
to
the

me
you

up
anymore
i’ve
got
eight
days
off
comin'
up
and
i
can
only
come
home
for
four
you
might
also
like
yeah
i
just
met
his
family
they're
just
like
you
and
mom

he
makes
me
really
happy
i
think
he
might
be
the
one
oh


i
swear
on
my
heart
that
he's
a
good
man
i

he
loves
me
he’d
never
hurt
me
you
held

someone
else
can

you
were
the
first
man
that
really
loved
me
now
you're
on
the
driveway
faking
a
smile
you
wish
you
could
tell
him
he
doesn't
deserve
me
so
i
had
to
stop
the
car
and
turn
around
to
tell
you
you
were
the
first
man
that
really
loved
me


ah
ah
ah
ah
ah

and
before
they
open
up
the
doors
i
say
"i've
never
seen
you
cry
before"
you
say
"you've
never
looked
so
beautiful
you
know
you'll
always
be
my
little

you're
looking
at
me
while
walking
down
the
aisle
with
tears
in
your
eyes
maybe
he
deserves
me
you
don't
even
know
how
much
it
means
to
me
now
that
you
were
