what
if
what
if
we
run
away
what
if
what
if
we
left
today
what
if
we
said
goodbye
to
safe
and
sound
and
what
if
what
if
we're
hard
to
find
what
if
what
if
we
lost
our
minds
what
if
we
let
them
fall
behind
and
they're
never
found


and
when
the
lights
start
flashing
like
a
photobooth
and
the
stars
exploding
we’ll
be
fireproof

my
youth

on

my

yours
runaway
now
and
forevermore
my

my

a

so
loud
you
can't
ignore
my
youth
my
youth
my
youth
my
youth
is
yours


what
if
what
if
we
start
to
drive
what
if
what
if
we
close
our
eyes
what
if
we're
speeding
through
red
lights
into
paradise
cause
we've
no
time
for
getting
old
mortal
body;
timeless
souls
cross
your
fingers
here
we
go
you
might
also
like
and
when
the
lights
start
flashing
like

what

everything
is
shattering

your
obsession
with
the
little
things
you
like

i
like

i
don’t
give
a

i'm
not

still

strawberries
&
cigarettes
lyrics
remember
when
we
first
met
you
said
"light
my
cigarette"
so
i
lied
to
my
mum
and
dad
i
jumped
the
fence
and
i
ran
but
we
couldn't
go
very
far
'cause
you
locked
your
keys
in
your
car
so
you
sat
and
stared
at
my
lips
and
i
could
already
feel
your
kiss


long
nights
daydreams
sugar
and
smoke
rings
i've
been
a
fool
but
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
you
headlights
on
me
racing
to
60
i've
been
a
fool
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
blue
eyes
black
jeans
lighters
and
candy
i've
been
a
fool
but
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
you


remember
when
you
taught
me
fate
said
it'd
all
be
worth
the
wait
like
that
night
in
the
back
of
the
cab
when
your
fingers
walked
in
my
hand
next
day
nothin'
on
my
phone
but
i
can
still
smell
you
on
my
clothes
always
hoping
that
things
would
change
but
we
went
right
back
to
your
games
you
might
also
like
long
nights
daydreams
sugar
and
smoke
rings
i've
been
a
fool
but

and
even
if
i
run
away
give
my
heart
a
holiday
still
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
you
you
always
leave
me
wanting
more
i
can't
shake
my
hunger
for
strawberries
and
cigarettes
always
taste
like
you
yeah
they
always
taste
like
you
you
long
nights

with
that
sugar

i
got
the
good
side
of
things
left
you
with
both
of
the
rings
my
fingers
danced
and
swayed
in
the
breeze
the
change
in
the
wind
took
you
down
to
your
knees
i
got
the
good
side
of
you
send
it
out
into
the
blue
the
people
danced
to
the
sound
of
your
heart
the
world
sang
along
to
it
falling
apart


but
i
sympathize
and
i
recognize
and
baby
i
apologize
that
i
got
the
good
side
the
good
side
of
things


i
got
the
good
side
of
life
travelled
the
universe
twice
so
many
thoughts
i
wanted
to
share
but
i
didn't
call
because
it
wouldn't
be
fair
then
i
got
the
good
side
of
new
found
arms
to
fall
right
into
i
know
how
it
looked
it
wasn't
the
plan
and
some
day
i
hope
that
you'll
understand
you
might
also
like
that
i
sympathize
and
i
recognize
and
baby
i
apologize
that
i
got
the
good
side
the
good
side
of
things


i'm
sure
we'll
meet
in
the
spring
and
catch
up
on
everything
i'll
say
i'm
proud
of
all
that
you've
done
you
taught
me
the
ropes
and
you
taught
me
to
love


but
i
sympathize
and
i
recognize

i
apologize
