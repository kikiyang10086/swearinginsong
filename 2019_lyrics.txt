lot
of
nothing

a
deed
to
the
land
but
it

god's
country
we
pray
for
rain
and

him

it's
fallin'
'cause
it
brings
a
grain
and
a
little
bit
of
money
we
put
it
back
in
a
plate
i
guess
that's
why
they
call
it
god's
country
i
saw
the
light
in
a
sunrise
sittin'
back
in
a
40
on
the
muddy
river
side
gettin'
baptized
in
holy
water
and
shine
with
the
dogs
runnin'
saved
by
the
sound
of
the
been
found
dixie
whistle
in
the
wind
that'll
get
you
heaven
bound
the
devil
went
down
to
georgia
but
he
didn't
stick
around
this
is
god's
country
we
turn
the
dirt
and
work
until
the
week's
done
we
take
a
break
and
break
bread
on
sunday
then
do
it
all
again
'cause
we're
proud
to
be
from
god's
country

care
what
my
headstone
reads
or
what
kind
of
pine
wood
box
i
end
up
in
when
it's
my
time

me
six
feet
deep
in
god's

but

this
is
god's
country
i
look
up
from
the
ground
to
see
your
sad
and
teary
eyes
you
look
away
from
me
and
i
see
there's
something
you're
trying
to
hide
and
i
reach
for
your
hand
but
it's
cold
you
pull
away
again
and
i
wonder
what's
on
your
mind
and
then
you
say
to
me
you
made
a
dumb
mistake
you
start
to
tremble
and
your
voice
begins
to
break
you
say
the
cigarettes
on
the
counter
weren't
your
friends
they
were
my
mates
and
i
feel
the
color
draining
from
my
face
and
my
friend
said
&quot;i
know
you
love
her
but
it's
over
mate
it
doesn't
matter
put
the
phone
away
it's
never
easy
to
walk
away
let
her
go
it'll
be
alright&quot;
so
i
still
look
back
at
all
the
messages
you'd
sent
and
i
know
it
wasn't
right
but
it
was
fucking
with
my
head
and
everything
deleted
like
the
past
yeah
it
was
gone
and
when
i
touched
your
face
i
could
tell
you're
moving
on
but
it's
not
the
fact
that
you
kissed
him
yesterday
it's
the
feeling
of
betrayal
that
i
just
can't
seem
to
shake
and
everything
i
know
tells
me
that
i
should
walk
away
but
i
just
want
to
stay
and
my
friend
said
&quot;i
know
you
love
her
but
it's
over
mate
it
doesn't
matter
put
the
phone
away
it's
never
easy
to
walk
away
let
her
go

be

gonna
hurt
for
a
bit
of
time

find
another
and

her
go&quot;
nothing
heals
the
past
like
time
and
they
can't
steal
the
love
you're
born
to
find
but
nothing
