lyrics
my
mother
said
i'm
too
romantic
she
said
"you're
dancing
in
the
movies"
i
almost
started
to
believe
her
then
i
saw
you
and
i
knew
maybe
it's
'cause
i
got
a
little
bit
older
maybe
it's
all
that
i've
been
through
i'd
like
to
think
it's
how
you
lean
on
my
shoulder
and
how
i
see
myself
with
you


i
don't
say
a
word
but
still
you
take
my
breath
and
steal
the
things
i
know
there
you
go
saving
me
from
out
of
the
cold


fire
on
fire
would
normally
kill
us
but
this
much
desire
together
we're
winners
they
say
that
we're
out
of
control
and
some
say
we're
sinners
but
don't
let
them
ruin
our
beautiful
rhythms
'cause
when
you
unfold
me
and
tell
me
you
love
me
and
look
in
my
eye
you
are
perfection
my
only
direction
it's
fire

mmm
it's
fire
on
fire
you
might
also
like
when
we
fight
we
fight
like
lions
but
then
we
love
and
feel
the
truth
we
lose
our
minds
in
a
city
of
roses
we
won't
abide
by
any
rules

salt
of
the
soul
