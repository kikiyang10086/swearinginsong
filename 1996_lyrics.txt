when
it
was
you
and
me
girl
i
was
free
see
you
had
my
heart
from
the
start
like
cupid
and
i
was
just
down
right
foolish
and
stupid
but
now
i
know
the
reason
for
the
pain
and
the
headaches
you
left
me
all
alone
now
i
can't
even
concentrate
i
guess
i'll
wait
for
the
day
until
you
come
back
because
my
heart
is
where
your
love
is
at
you
got
me
twisted
[repeat

you
don't

hanging
around

have
proved
to
offer
nothing

an
old
man
turned
ninety-eight
he
won
the
lottery
and
died
the
next
day
it's
a
black
fly
in
your
chardonnay
it's
a
death
row
pardon
two
minutes
too
late
and
isn't
it
ironic
don't
you
think
it's
like
rain
on
your
wedding
day
it's
a
free
ride
when
you've
already
paid
it's
the
good
advice
that
you
just
didn't
take
and
who
would've
thought
it
figures
mr.
play-it-safe
was
afraid
to
fly
he
packed
his
suitcase
and
kissed
his
kids
goodbye
he
waited
his
whole
damn
life
to
take
that
flight
and
as
the
plane
crashed
down
he
thought
&quot;well
isn't
this
nice&quot;
and
isn't
it
ironic
don't
you
think
it's
like
rain
on
your
wedding
day
it's
a
free
ride

advice
that
you
just
didn't
take
and
who
would've
thought
it
figures
well
life
has
a
funny
way
of
sneaking
up
on
you
when
you
think
everything's
okay
and
everything's
going
right
and
life
has
a
funny
way
of
helping
you
out
when
you
think
everything's
gone
wrong
and
everything
blows
up
in
your
face
it's
a
traffic
jam
when
you're
already
late
a
&quot;no
smoking&quot;
sign
on
your
cigarette
break
it's
like
ten
thousand
spoons
when
all
you
need
is
a
knife
it's
meeting
the
man
of
my
dreams
and
then
meeting
his
beautiful
wife
and
isn't
it
ironic
don't
you
think
a
little
too
ironic
and
yeah
i
really
do
think
it's
like
rain
on
your
wedding
day
it's
a
free
ride
when
you've
already

a
funny
way

sneaking
up
on
you
and
life
has
a
funny
funny
way
of
helping
you
out

you
out
everyone
falls
in
love
sometime
sometimes
it's
wrong
and
sometimes
it's
right
for
every
win
someone
must
fail

point
when

reach
out
tell
me
where
to
start
cause
everytime
you
smile
i
feel
trembles
in
my
heart
i
have
but
one
concern
how
can
i
get
with
you
til
my
day
comes
here's
what
i'm
gonna
do
be
sitting
up
in
my
room
back
here
thinking
bout
you
i
must
confess
i'm
a
mess
for
you
be
sitting
up
in
my
room
back
here
thinking
bout
you
i'm
just
a
mess
with
a
thang
for
you
there
were
nights
when
the
wind
was
so
cold
that
my
body
froze
in
bed
if
i
just
listened
to
it
right
outside
the
window
there
were
days
when
the
sun
was
so
cruel
that
all
the
tears
turned
to
dust
and
i
just
knew
my
eyes
were
drying
up
forever
i
finished
crying
in
the
instant
that
you
left
and
i
can't
remember
where
or
when
or
how
and
i
banished
every
memory
you
and
i
had
ever
made
but
when
you
touch
me
like
this
and
you
hold
me
like
that
i
just
have
to
admit
that
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
when
i
touch
you
like
this
and
i
hold
you
like
that
it's
so
hard
to
believe
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
it's
all
coming
back
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now
there
were
moments
of
gold
and
there
were
flashes
of
light
there
were
things
i'd
never
do
again
but
then
they'd
always
seemed
right
there
were
nights
of
endless
pleasure
it
was
more
than
any
laws
allow
baby
baby
if
i
kiss
you
like
this
and
if
you
whisper
like
that
it
was
lost
long
ago
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
if
you
want
me
like
this
and
if
you
need
me
like
that
it
was
dead
long
ago
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
it's
so
hard
to
resist
and
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
i
can
barely
recall
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now
but
it's
all
coming
back
there
were
those
empty
threats
and
hollow
lies
and
whenever
you
tried
to
hurt
me
i
just
hurt
you
even
worse
and
so
much
deeper
there
were
hours
that
just
went
on
for
days
when
alone
at
last
we'd
count
up
all
the
chances
that
were
lost
to
us
forever
but
you
were
history
with
the
slamming
of
the
door
and
i
made
myself
so
strong
again
somehow
and
i
never
wasted
any
of
my
time
on
you
since
then
but
if
i
touch
you
like
this
and
if
you
kiss
me
like
that
it
was
so
long
ago
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
if
you
touch
me
like
this
and
if
i
kiss
you
like
that
it
was
gone
with
the
wind
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
it's
all
coming
back
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now
there
were
moments
of
gold
and
there
were
flashes
of
light
there
were
things
we'd
never
do
again
but
then
they'd
always
seemed
right
there
were
nights
of
endless
pleasure
it
was
more
than
all
your
laws
allow
baby
baby
baby
when
you
touch
me
like
this
and
when
you
hold
me
like
that
it
was
gone
with
the
wind
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
when
you
see
me
like
this
and
when
i
see
you
like
that
then
we
see
what
we
want
to
see
all
coming
back
to
me
the
flesh
and
the
fantasies
all
coming
back
to
me
i
can
barely
recall
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now
if
you
forgive
me
all
this
if
i
forgive
you
all
that
we
forgive
and
forget
and
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
when
you
see
me
like
this
and
when
i
see
you
like
that
we
see
just
what
we
want
to
see
all
coming
back
to
me
the
flesh
and
the
fantasies
all
coming
back
to
me
i
can
barely
recall
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now.
and
when
you
kiss
me
like
this
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now.
and
when
i
touch
you
like
that
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now.
if
you
do
it
like
this
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now.
and
if
we...
if
i
could
reach
the
stars
pull
one
down
for
you
shine
it
on
my
heart
so
you
could
see
the
truth
that
this
love
i
have
inside
is
everything
it
seems
but
for
now
i
find
it's
only
in
my
dreams
and
i
can
change
the
world
i
will
be
the
sunlight
in
your
universe
you
would
think
my
love
was
really
something
good
baby
if
i
could
change
the
world
if
i
could
be
king
even
for
a
day
i'd
take
you
as
my
queen
i'd
have
it
no
other
way
and
our
love
would
rule
in
this
kingdom
we
have
made
'til
then
i'd
be
a
fool
wishing
for
the
day
and
i
can
change
the
world
i
would
be
the
sunlight
in
your
universe
you
would
think
my
love
was
really
something
good
baby
if
i
could
change
the
world
baby
if
i
could
change
the
world
i
could
change
the
world
i
would
be
the
sunlight
in
your
universe
you
would
think
my

was

if
i

the
world
baby
if
i
could
change
the
world
baby
if
i
could
change
the
world
i've
been
watchin'
you
from
afar
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
you
are
all
a
real
man
can
need
and
ever
ask
for
this
is
love
this
is
more
than
a
crush
it
was
harlem
at
the
ruckers
i
saw
you
with
your
man
smiling
huh
a
coach
bag
in
your
hand
i
was
laying
in
the
coupe
with
my
hat
turned
back
we
caught
eyes
for
a
moment
and
that
was
that
so
i
skated
off
as
you
strolled
off
looking
at
them
legs
god
damn
they
looked
so
soft
so
fine
i
gotta
take
you
from
your
man.
that's
my
mission
if
his
love
is
real
he
got
to
handle
competition
you
only
knew
him
for
5
months
that's
right
besides
he
drink
too
much
and
smoke
too
many
blunts
and
i've
been
working
out
everyday
thinking
bout
you
looking
at
my
own
eyes
in
the
rear
view
catchin'
flashbacks
of
our
eye
contact
wish
i
could
lay
you
on
your
stomach
and
caress
your
back
i
would
hold
you
in
my
arms
and
ease
your
fears
i
can't
believe
it
i
ain't
had
a
crush
in
years
hey
lover
hey
lover
this
is
more
than
a
crush
hey
lover
hey
lover
this

hey

hey
lover
this
is
more

i
see
you
at
the
bus
stop
waiting
everyday
your
man
must
think
it's
safe
for
you
to
travel
that
way
but
i
don't
want
to
violate
your
relationship
so
i
lay
back
in
the
cut
with
a
crush
that's
a
trip
still
he
can't
stop
me
from
having
day
dreams
tonguing
you
down
with
huh
vanilla
ice
cream
kissing
on
your
thighs
in
the
moonlight
searching
your
body
with
my
tongue
girl
all
night
i
wonder
one
day
could
it
be
simple
dreams
could
turn
into
reality
our
love
would
come
down
so
naturally
we
would
walk
down
the
aisle
of
destiny
what
your
man
got
his
hustle
on
gotcha
type
scared
break
you
off
a
little
chump
change
to
do
your
hair
that
seems
to
be
enough
to
satisfy
your
needs
but
there's
a
deeper
level
if
you'd
follow
my
lead
hey
lover
hey
lover
hey
lover
this
is
more
than
a

hey

last
week
i
saw
you
at
the
mall
standing
at
the
pay
phone
'bout
to
make
a
call
i
had
a
vision
it
was
me
on
the
other
end
telling
you
come
by
and
then
you
walked
in
i
touched
you
gently
with
my
hands
we
talked
about
traveling
the
distant
lands
escaping
all
the
madness
out
here
in
the
world
becoming
my
wife.
no
longer
my
girl
then
you
let
your
dress
fall
down
to
the
floor
i
kissed
you
softly
and
you
yearned
for
more
we
experienced
pleasure
unparalleled
into
an
ocean
of
love
we
both
fell
swimming
in
the
timeless
currents
of
pure
bliss
fantasies
interchanging
with
each
kiss
undying
passion
unites
our
souls
together
we
swim
until
the
point
of
no
control
but
it's
a
fantasy.
it
won't
come
true
we
never
even
spoke
and
your
man
swear
he
love
you
so
i'mma
keep
all
these
feelings
inside
that's
right
keep
my
dreams
alive
until
the
right
time

[chorus]
how
do
you
cool
your
lips
after
a
summer's
kiss
how
do
you
rid
the
sweat

the

how
do
you
turn
your

how
do
you
block
the
sound
of
a
voice
you'd
know
anywhere
oh
i
really
should've
known
by
the
time
you
drove
me
home
by
the
vagueness
in
your
eyes
your
casual
goodbyes
by
the
chill
in
your
embrace
the
expression
on
your
face
that
told
me
maybe
you
might
have

you
numb
your
skin

it's
probably
ancient
history

one
of
the
chosen
few
who
went
ahead
and
fell
for
you

out

out
of
touch

fell

thought
that
you
might
have
some
advice
to
give
on
how
to
be
insensitive

really
should've
known

the
time
you
drove
me
home
by
the
vagueness
in
your
eyes
your
casual
goodbyes
by
the
chill
in
your
embrace
the
expression
on
your
face
that
told
me
maybe
you
might
have
some
advice
to
give
on
how

you
never

got
tossed

you
never
meant

got
lost

thrown
away

never
knew
their
names
we
don't
belong

no
one

tell
no
one
your
name

won't
tell
'em
your

the
past

yourself
somewhere
out
there
did
you
get
to
be
a
star

don't
it
make
you
sad
to
know
that
life
is
more
than
who
we
are
we
grew
up
way
too
fast
and
now
there's
nothing
to
believe
and
reruns
all
become
our
history
a
tired
song
keeps
playing
on
a
tired
radio
and
i
won't
tell
no
one
your
name
and
i
won't
tell
'em
your
name
i
won't

won't
tell
'em
your

people
living
their
lives
for
you
on
tv
they
say

had
their

we
pray
to
as
many
different
gods
as
there
are
flowers
but
we
call
religion
our
friend
we're
so
worried
about
saving
our
souls
afraid
that
god
will
take
his
toll
that
we
forget
to
begin
but
who
will
save
your

for
the

bad
timing

to
my
great
surprise
ever
since
i
looked
in
your
eyes
i
had
one
question
for
you
[hook:]
tell
me
if
you
want
me
to
give
you
all
my
time

wanna
make
it
good
for
you
cause
you
blow
my
mind
i
promise
boy
that
i'll
be
true
you're
the
perfect
find
so
tell
me
if
you
want
me
to
yeah
if
you've
thought
i'd
sleep
on
this
boy
you're
wrong
cause
all
i
dream
about
is
our
first
kiss
and
you're
the
first
one
to
make
me
feel
like
this
and
this
is
one
opportunity
that
i
can't
miss
no
no
boy
you
wanna
know
the
deal
you
are
wondering
if
the
words
i'm
saying
are
for
real
cause
you
got
more
appeal
than
any
man
in
this
whole
world
and
baby
i
got
to
know
how
you
feel
yeah
[hook]
sweetheart
now
it's
time
i
let
you
know
i
don't
wanna
rush
we
should
take
it
slow
boy
i
can
love
you
can
you
help
me
grow
give
me
a
new
beginning
and
i'll
give
you
a
happy
ending
[hook
x3]
it
doesn't
matter
what
i
say
so
long
as
i
sing
with
inflection
that
makes
you
feel
i'll
convey
some
inner
truth
or
vast
reflection
but
i've
said
nothing
so
far
and
i
can
keep
it
up
for
as
long
as
it
takes
and
it
don't
matter
who
you
are
if
i'm
doing
my
job
then
it's
your
resolve
that
breaks
because
the
hook
brings
you
back
i
ain't
tellin'
you
no
lie
the
hook
brings
you
back
on
that
you
can
rely
there
is
something
amiss
i
am
being
insincere
in
fact
i
don't
mean
any
of
this
still
my
confession
draws
you
near
to
confuse
the
issue
i
refer
to
familiar
heroes
from
long
ago
no
matter
how
much
peter
loved
her
what
made
the
pan
refuse
to
grow
was
that
the
hook
brings
you
back
i
ain't
tellin'
you
no
lie
the
hook
brings
you
back
on
that
you

or
anne
boleyn
make
a
desperate
move
or
else
you'll
win
and
then
begin
to
see
what
you're
doing
to
me
this
mtv
is
not
for
free
it's
so
pc
it's
killing
me
so
desperately
i
sing
to
thee
of
love
sure
but
also
of
rage
and
hate
and
pain
and
fear
of
self
and
i
can't
keep
these
feelings
on
the
shelf
i've
tried
well
no
in
fact
i
lied
could
be
financial
suicide
but
i've
got
too
much
pride
inside
to
hide
or
slide
i'll
do
as
i'll
decide
and
let
it
ride
until
i've
died
and
only
then
shall
i
abide
this
tide
of
catchy
little
tunes
of
hip
three
minute
ditties
i
wanna
bust
all
your
balloons
i
wanna
burn
all
your
cities
to
the
ground
i've
found
i
will
not
mess
around
unless
i
play
then
hey
i
will
go
on
all
day.

what
i
say
i
have
a
prayer
to
pray
that's
really
all
this
was
and
when
i'm
feeling
stuck
and
need
a
buck
i
don't
rely
on
luck
because
the
hook
brings
you
back
i
ain't
tellin'
you
no
lie
the
hook...
on
that
you
can
rely

me
have
any
rights
oh
i've
had
it
up
to
here
the
moment
that
i
step
outside
so
many
reasons
for
me
to
run
and
hide
i
can't
do
the
little
things
i
hold
so
dear
'cause
it's
all
those
little
things
that
i
fear

rather
not
be

they
won't
let
me
drive
late
at
night
oh
i'm
just
a
girl

i'm
some
kind
of
freak

they
all
sit

stare
with
their
eyes

i'm
just
a

take
a
good
look
at
me
just
your
typical
prototype

i've
had
it
up
to
here
oh
am
i
making
myself
clear
i'm
just
a
girl
i'm
just
a

in
the

that's
all
that
you'll
let
me

i'm
just
a
girl
living
in
captivity
your
rule
of
thumb
makes
me
worrisome
oh
i'm
just
a
girl
what's
my
destiny
what
i've
succumbed
to
is
making
me
numb

my

what
i've
become
is
so
burdensome

i'm

lucky
me
twiddle-dum
there's
no
comparison

i've
had
it

were
singing
your

i'm
still
recalling

carried
them
with
me
today

i
am
not
above
the
sorrow
heavy
hearted
till
you
call
my
name

it
sounds

church
bells

the
whistle
of
a
train
on
a
summer
evening
i'll
run
to
meet
you
barefoot
barely

while
you
got
the
oppurtunity.
to
be

it.
like
your
prey
make
your
move

up
on

you've
been
gone
babe
no
friends
to
understand
to
lend
a
helping

to
ease
the
greatest
pain
i've
ever
known
how
you
walked
away
so
easily
still
remains
a
mystery
to
me
don't
you
remember
that
you
promised
me
yes
you
promised
me
that
you'd
never
leave
boy
but
you
went
away
babe
and
it's
such
a
shame
how
could
you
turn
your
back
on
me
[chorus:]
if
you
really
don't

was
there
whenever

would
call
me
baby

somehow
your
feelings
changed
you
don't

you're
not
the
man
that
i
once
knew
at
all
how
you
walked
away

feel
it's
time
got
a
picture
of
you
beside
me
got
your
lipstick
mark
still
on
your
coffee
cup
got
a
fist
of
pure
emotion
got
a
head
of
shattered
dreams
gotta
leave
it
gotta
leave
it
all
behind
now

i
just
want
you
back
for
good
whenever
i'm
wrong
just
tell
me
the
song
and
i'll
sing
it
you'll
be
right
and
understood
unaware
but
underlined
i
figured
out
this
story
it
wasn't
good
but
in
the
corner
of
my
mind
i
celebrated
glory
but
that
was
not
to
be
in
the
twist
of
separation
you
excelled
at
being
free
can't
you
find
a
little
room
inside
for
me
whatever
i
said
whatever
i
did
i
didn't
mean
it
i
just
want
you
back
for
good
whenever
i'm
wrong
just
tell
me
the
song
and
i'll
sing
it
you'll
be
right
and
understood
and
we'll
be
together
this
time
is
forever
we'll
be
fighting
and
forever
we
will
be
so
complete
in
our
love
we
will
never
be
uncovered
again
whatever
