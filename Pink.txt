a
reason
lyrics
right
from
the
start
you
were
a
thief
you
stole
my
heart
and
i
your
willing
victim
i
let
you
see
the
parts
of
me
that
weren't
all
that
pretty
and
with
every
touch
you
fixed
them


now
you've
been
talking
in
your
sleep
oh
oh
things
you
never
say
to
me
oh
oh
tell
me
that
you've
had
enough
of
our
love
our
love


just
give
me
a
reason
just
a
little
bit's
enough
just
a
second
-
we're
not
broken
just
bent
and
we
can
learn
to
love
again
it's
in
the
stars
it's
been
written
in
the
scars
on
our
hearts
we're
not
broken
just
bent
and

i'm
sorry
i
don't
understand
where
all
of
this
is
coming
from
i
thought
that
we
were
fine

your
head
is
running
wild
again
my
dear
we
still
have
everything
and
it's
all
in
your
mind

you
might
also
like
you've
been
having
real
bad
dreams
oh
oh
you
used
to
lie
so
close
to
me
oh
oh
there's
nothing
more
than
empty
sheets
between
our
love
our
love
oh
our
love
our
love
love

i'll
fix
it
for
us
we're
collecting
dust
but
our
love's
enough
you're
holding
it
in
you're
pouring
a
drink
no
nothing
is
as
bad
as
it

up
oh


'cause
i've
been
on

long
they
can't

you're
waking
up

remember
i'm
pretty
and
when
the
chemicals
leave
my
body
yeah
they're
gonna
find
me
in

if
we
don't

felt
alone
still
feel
afraid
i

through

i

someone
would

up

you're
left
naked

when
the

just

people
and
you're
not
better
than
me
i'd
like
to
ask
you
some
questions
if
we
can
speak
honestly


what
do
you
feel
when
you
see
all
the
homeless
on
the
street
who
do
you
pray
for
at
night
before
you
go
to
sleep
what
do
you
feel
when
you
look
in
the
mirror
are
you
proud


how
do
you
sleep
while
the
rest
of
us
cry
how
do
you
dream
when
a
mother
has
no
chance
to
say
goodbye
how
do
you
walk
with
your
head
held
high
can
you
even
look
me
in
the
eye
and
tell
me
why


dear
mr
president
were
you
a
lonely
boy

are
you
a
lonely

how
can
you
say
"no
child
is
left
behind"
we're
not
dumb
and
we're
not
blind

they're
all
sitting

you
pave

it
screams
the
truth
please
don't
tell
me
that
we
had
that
conversation

'cause
i
won't

save
your

'cause
what's
the
use
you
might
