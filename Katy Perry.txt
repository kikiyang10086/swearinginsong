there's
a

there's
a
pounding
in
my
head
glitter
all
over
the

pink
flamingos
in
the
pool
i
smell
like
a
minibar
dj's
passed
out
in
the
yard
barbies
on
the
barbecue
this
a

ended
up

i'm

blur

i'm
pretty
sure
it
ruled
damn


last
friday
night
yeah
we
danced
on
tabletops
and
we
took
too
many

we
kissed

i
forgot
last
friday
night
yeah
we
maxed
our

cards
and
got
kicked
out
of
the
bar
so
we
hit
the
boulevard
last
friday
night
we
went
streaking
in
the
park
skinny
dipping
in
the
dark
then
had
a
ménage
à
trois
last
friday
