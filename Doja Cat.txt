ends
with
a

i
can’t
handle
rejection
stand
my
reflection
damn
no
one
gets
it
should
i
be
kind
and
remind
that
i’m
weak
so
i
fall
more
behind
every

i'm
the

stairs
to

to

to
the

mutter
in
my

i

"mother
never

my

finds
blood
i
say
"shut
up
'fore

what
the

is
my

next
