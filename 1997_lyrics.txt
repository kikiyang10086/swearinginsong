i'm
packed
and
i'm
holding
i'm
smiling
she's
living
she's
golden
she
lives
for
me
says
she
lives
for
me
ovation
her
own
motivation
she
comes
'round
and
she
goes
down
on
me
and
i
make
her
smile
like
a
drug
for
you
do
ever
what
you
want
to
do
coming
over
you
keep
on
smiling
what
we
go
through
one
stop
to
the
rhythm
that
divides
you
and
i
speak
to
you
like
the
chorus
to
the
verse
chop
another
line
like
a
coda
with
a
curse
come
on
like
a
freak
show
takes
the
stage
we
give
them
the
games
we
play
she
say
i
want
something
else
to
get
me
through
this
semi-charmed
kind
of
life
baby
baby
i
want
something
else
i'm
not
listening
when
you
say
goodbye

the
sky
was
gold
it
was
rose
i
was
taking
sips
up
into
my
nose
and
i
wish
i
could
get
back
there
some
place
back
there
smiling
in
the
pictures
you
would
take
doing
crystal
meth
will
lift
you
up
until
you
break
it
won't
stop
i
won't
come
down
i
keep
stock
with
a
tick-tock
rhythm
a
bump
for
the
drop
and
then
i
bumped
up
i
took
the
hit
that
i
was
given
then
i
bumped
again
then
i
bumped
again
i
said
how
do
i
get
back
there
to
the
place
where
i
fell
asleep
inside
you
how
do
i
get
myself
back
to
the
place
where
you
said
i
want
something
else
to
get
me
through
this
semi-charmed
kind
of
life
baby
baby
i
want
something
else
i'm
not
listening
when
you
say
goodbye
i
believe
in
the
sand
beneath
my
toes
the
beach
gives
a
feeling
an
earthy
feeling
i
believe
in
the
faith
that
grows
and
the
four
right
chords
can
make
me
cry
when
i'm
with
you
i
feel
like
i
could
die
and
that
would
be
alright
alright
and
when
the
plane
came
in
she
said
she
was
crashing
the
velvet
it
rips
in
the
city
we
tripped
on
the
urge
to
feel
alive
but
now
i'm
struggling
to
survive
those
days
you
were
wearing
that
velvet
dress
you're
the
priestess
i
must
confess
those
little
red
panties
they
pass
the
test
so
slide
up
'round
the
belly
face
down
on
the
mattress
one
and
you
hold
me
and
we
are
broken
still
it's
all
that
i
want
to
do
just
a
little
now
feel
myself
hovering
off
the
ground
i'm
scared
i'm
not
coming
down
no
no
and
i
won't
run
for
my
life
she's
got
her
jaws
now
locked
down
in
a
smile
but
nothing
is
alright
alright
and
i
want
something
else
to
get
me
through
this
life
baby
i
want
something
else
not
listening
when
you
say
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye

the

was
gold
it
was
rose
i
was
taking
sips
up
into
my
nose
and
i
wish
i
could
get
back
there
some
place
back
there
in
the
place
we
used
to
start
our
lives
doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo
i
want
something
else
i
know
what
you're
doing
i
see
it
all
too
clear
i
only
taste
the
saline
when
i
kiss
away
your
tears
you
really
had
me
going
wishing
on
a
star
the
black
holes
that
surround
you
are
heavier
by
far
i
believed
in
your
confusion
so
completely
torn
must
have
been
that
yesterday
was
the
day
that
i
was
born
there's
not
much
to
examine
there's
nothing
left
to
hide
you
really
can't
be
serious
if
you
have
to
ask
me
why
i
say
goodbye
'cause
i
am
barely
breathing
and
i
can't
find
the
air
don't
know
who
i'm
kidding
imagining
you
care
and
i
could
stand
here
waiting
a
fool
for
another
day
i
don't
suppose
it's
worth
the
price
it's
worth
the
price
the
price
that
i
would
pay
yeah
yeah
yeah
everyone
keeps
asking
what's
it
all
about
i
used
to
be
so
certain
now
i
can't
figure
out
what
is
this
attraction
i
only
feel
the
pain
there's
nothing
left
to
reason
and
only
you
to
blame
will
it
ever
change
'cause
i
am
barely
breathing
and
i
can't
find
the
air
don't
know
who
i'm

it's

the
price
it's
worth
the
price
the
price
that
i
would
pay
yeah
yeah
yeah
but
i'm
thinking
it
over
anyway
i'm
thinking
it
over
anyway
i've
come
to
find
i
may
never
know
your
changing
mind
is
it
friend
or
foe
i
rise
above
or
sink
below
with
every
time
you
come
and
go
please
don't
come
and
go
'cause
i
am
barely

i'm

i'm
thinking
it
over
anyway
well
i
know
what
you're
doing
i
see
it
all
too
clear
&quot;everybody
needs
a
little
time
away&quot;
i
heard
her
say
&quot;from
each
other.&quot;
even
lovers
need
a
holiday
far
away
from
each
other
hold
me
now
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
i'm
sorry
i
just
want
you
to
stay
with
me
and
after
all
that
you've
been
through
i
will
make
it
up
to
you
i
promise
you
baby
and
after
all
that's
been
said
and
done
you're
just
the
part
of
me
i
can't
let
go
couldn't
stand
to
be
kept
away
not
for
a
day
from
your
body
wouldn't
wanna
be
swept
away
away
far
away
from
the
one
that
i
love
hold
me
now
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
i'm
sorry
i
just
want
you
to
know
hold
me
now
i
really
want
to
tell
you
i'm
sorry
i
could
never
let
you
go
and
after
all
that
we've
been
through
i
will
make
it
up
to
you
i
promise
you
and
after
all
that's
been
said
and
done
you're
just
a
part
of
me
i
can't
let
go
i
can't
let
go.
anytime
i
need
to
see
your
face
i
just
close
my
eyes
and
i
am
taken
to
a
place
where
your
crystal
mind
and
magenta
feelings
take
up
shelter
in
the
base
of
my
spine
sweet
like
a
chic-a-cherry
cola
i
don't
need
to
try
to
explain;
i
just
hold
on
tight
and
if
it
happens
again
i
might
move
so
slightly
to
the
arms
and
the
lips
and
the
face
of
the
human
cannonball
that
i
need
to
i
want
to
come
stand
a
little
bit
closer
breathe
in
and
get
a
bit
higher
you'll
never
know
what
hit
you
when
i
get
to
you

to
find
out
i'm
the
kind
of
person
who
endorses
a
deep
commitment
getting
comfy
getting
perfect
is
what
i
live
for
but
a
look
then
a
smell
of
perfume
it's
like
i'm
down
on
the
floor
and
i
don't
know
what
i'm
in
for
conversation
has
a
time
and
place
in
the
interaction
of
a
lover
and
a
mate
but
the
time
of
talking
using
symbols
using
words
can
be
likened
to
a
deep
sea
diver
who
is
swimming
with
a
raincoat
come
stand
a
little
bit
closer
breathe
in
and
get
a
bit
higher
you'll
never
know
what
hit
you
when

you
go
skinny-dippin'

there
were
nights
when
the
wind
was
so
cold
that
my
body
froze
in
bed
if
i
just
listened
to
it
right
outside
the
window
there
were
days
when
the
sun
was
so
cruel
that
all
the
tears
turned
to
dust
and
i
just
knew
my
eyes
were
drying
up
forever
i
finished
crying
in
the
instant
that
you
left
and
i
can't
remember
where
or
when
or
how
and
i
banished
every
memory
you
and
i
had
ever
made
but
when
you
touch
me
like
this
and
you
hold
me
like
that
i
just
have
to
admit
that
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
when
i
touch
you
like
this
and
i
hold
you
like
that
it's
so
hard
to
believe

it's
all
coming
back
to
me
it's
all
coming
back
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
now
there
were
moments
of
gold
and
there
were
flashes
of
light
there
were
things
i'd
never
do
again
but
then
they'd
always
seemed
right
there
were
nights
of
endless
pleasure
it
was
more
than
any
laws
allow
baby
baby
if
i
kiss
you
like
this
and
if
you
whisper
like
that
it
was
lost
long
ago
but
it's
all
coming
back
to
me
if
you
want
me
like
this
and
if
you
need
me
like
that
it
was
dead
long

it's
all
coming

me
now
but
it's
all
coming
back
there
were
those
empty
threats
and
hollow
lies
and
whenever
you
tried
to
hurt
me
i
just
hurt
you
even
worse
and
so
much
deeper
there
were
hours
that
just
went
on
for
days
when
alone
at
last
we'd
count
up
all
the
chances
that
were
lost
to
us
forever
but
you
were
history
with
the
slamming
of
the
door
and
i
made
myself
so
strong
again
somehow
and
i
never
wasted
any
of
my
time
on
you
since
then

if
i
touch
you

this

so
long
to
hear
the

it
comes
as
no

at
all
you

cut
the

i

your

you
don't

know
you're
being
unkind
so
much
for
all
your
high
brow
marxist
ways
just
use
me
up
and
then
you
walk
away.
boy
you
can't
play
me
that
way.
well
i
guess
what
you
say
is
true
i
could
never
be
the
right
kind
of
girl
for
you

i
could

when
i
saw
my
best

yesterday
she
said
she
never
liked
you
from
the
start
well
me
i
wish
that
i
could
claim
the
same
but
you
always
knew
you
held
my
heart.
and
you're
such
a
charming
handsome
man
now
i
think
i
finally
understand
is
it
in
your
genes
i
don't
know
but
i'll
soon
find
out
that's
for
sure
why
did
you
play
me
this
way
well
i
guess
what
you
say
is
true
i
could
never
be

i
could
never

well
i
guess
what
they
say
is
true
i
could
never
spend
my
life
with
a
man
like
you.
i
could
never
be
your
woman.
i
could
never
be
your

i

we
livin'
for
the
day
i
seen
a
man
get
swept
off
his
feet
by
a
boy
with
an
ak
the
situation
so
twisted
everybody
gettin
lifted
i'm
just
tryin
to
take
care
of
my
kids
and
handle
my
business
cause
it's
way
too
serious
so
you
gotta
pay
close
attention
so
you
don't
get
caught
slippin'
when
they
come
and
do
all
the
gettin'
life
is
a
big
game
so
you
gotta
play
it
with
a
big
heart
some
of
us
gotta
run
a
little
faster
cause
we
gotta
later
start
but
i'd
be
a
fool
to
surrender
when
i
know
i
can
be
a
contender
and
if
everybody's
a
sinner
then
everybody
could
ba
a
winner
no
matter
you
rag
color
deep
down
we
all
brothers
and
regardless
of
the
time
somebody
up
there
still
love
us
i'm
gonna
scuffle
and
struggle
until
i'm
breathless
and
weak
i
just
strived
my
whole
life
to
make
it
to
the
mountain
peak
always
keep
reachin'
be
sure
to
grab
hold
of
something
i'll
be
there
when
you
get
there
when
you
wit
the
sounds
bumpin'
[chorus:]
i'll
see
you
when
you
get
there
if
you
ever
get
there
see
you
when
you
get
there
i'll
see
you
when
you
get
there
if
you

get
there
see
you
when
you

[verse
3:
ps
of

thevz]
you
need
to
loosen
up
and
live
a
little
and
if
you
got
kids
let
them
know
how
you
feel
and
for
your
own
sake
give
a
little
oh
you
don't
want
to
hear
that
you
busy
tryin'
to
stack
and
keep
up
with
the
jones'
taking
advantage
of
your
own
the
realest
homies
that
you've
been
knowin'
for
the
longest
but
some
ain't
missing
a
good
thing
until
it's
gone
could
have
built
an
empire
if
not
for
the
jealousy
that
divides
us
we
prefer
to
keep
our
eyes
shut
to
describe
when
it's
something
wrong
and
we
desire
so
hold
your
head
up
high
if
your
poor
and
righteous
i
know
time
seems
strife
and
the
problems
seem
endless
but
at
times
of
despair
we
gotta
pull
ourselves
together
and
if
you
fell
you're
out
the
game
then
you
need
to
get
back
in
it
cause'
nothing
worse
than
a
quitter
you
gotta
face
responsibility
one
day
my
brother
so
gather
up
your
pitty
and
turn
it
to
ambition
and
put
your
vehicle
in
drive
and
stop
by
my
side
[chorus:]
[coolio]
as
we
walk
down
the
road
of
our
destiny
and
the
time
comes
to
choose
which
it
gonna
be
the
wide
and
crooked
or
the
straight
and
narrow
we
got
one
voice
to
give
and
one
life
to
live
stand
up
for
something
or
lie
down
in
your
game
listen
to
the
song
that
we
sing
it's
up
to
you
to
make
it
be
i
guess
i'll
see
you
when
you
see
me
[chorus

if
i
could
reach
the
stars
pull
one
down
for
you
shine
it
on
my

so
you
could
see
the
truth
that
this
love
i
have
inside
is
everything
it
seems
but
for
now
i
find
it's
only
in
my

i
can
change
the
world
i
will
be

could

take
you
as
my
queen
i'd
have
it
no
other
way
and
our
love
would
rule
in
this
kingdom
we
have
made
'til

i'd
be

i
have
often
dreamed
of
a
far
off
place
where
a
hero's
welcome
would
be
waiting
for
me
where
the
crowds
will
cheer
when
they
see
my
face
and
a
voice
keeps
saying
&quot;this
is
where
i'm
meant
to
be&quot;
i'll
be
there
someday
i
can
go
the
distance
i
will
find
my
way
if
i
can
be
strong
i
know
every
mile
will
be
worth
my
while
when
i
go
the
distance
i'll
be
right
where
i
belong
down
an
unknown
road
to
embrace
my
fate
though
that
road
may
wander
it
will
lead
me
to
you
and
a
thousand
years
would
be
worth
the
wait
it
might
take
a
lifetime
but
somehow
i'll
see
it
through
and
i
won't
look
back
i
can
go
the
distance
and
i'll
stay
on
track
no
i
won't
accept
defeat
it's
an
uphill
slope
but
i
won't
lose
hope
till
i
go
the
distance
and
my
journey
is
complete
but
to
look
beyond
the
glory
is
the
hardest
part
for
a
hero's
strength
is
measured
by
his
heart
like
a
shooting
star
i
will
go
the
distance
i
will
search
the
world
i
will
face
its
harms
i
don't
care
how
far
i
can
go
the
distance
till
i
find
my
hero's
welcome
waiting
in
your
arms
i
will
search
the
world
i
will
