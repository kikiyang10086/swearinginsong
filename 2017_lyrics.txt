me
do
when
i
was
six
years
old
i
broke
my
leg
i
was
running
from
my
brother
and
his
friends
and
tasted
the
sweet
perfume
of
the
mountain
grass
i
rolled
down
i
was
younger
then
take
me
back
to
when
i
found
my
heart
and
broke
it
here
made
friends
and
lost
them
through
the
years
and
i've
not
seen
the
roaring
fields
in
so
long
i
know
i've
grown
but
i
can't
wait
to
go
home
i'm
on
my
way
driving
at
90
down
those
country
lanes
singing
to
&quot;tiny
dancer&quot;
and
i
miss
the
way
you
make
me
feel
and
it's
real
when
we
watched
the
sunset
over
the
castle
on
the
hill
fifteen
years
old
and
smoking
hand-rolled
cigarettes
running
from
the
law
through
the
backfields
and
getting
drunk
with
my
friends
had
my
first
kiss
on
a
friday
night
i
don't
reckon
that
i
did
it
right
i
was
younger
then
take
me
back
to
when
we
found
weekend
jobs
when
we
got
paid
we'd
buy
cheap
spirits
and
drink
them
straight
me
and
my
friends
have
not
thrown
up
in
so
long
oh
how
we've
grown
but
i
can't
wait
to
go
home
i'm
on
my
way
driving
at
90
down
those
country
lanes
singing

down
by
the

one's
already
on
his
second

one's
just
barely
getting
by
but
these
people
raised
me
and
i
can't
wait
to
go
home
and
i'm
on
my
way
i
still
remember
these
old
country
lanes
when
we
did
not
know
the
answers
and
i
miss
the
way
you
make
me
feel
and
it's
real
when
we
watched
the

over

i
never
came
to
the
beach
or
stood
by
the
ocean
i
never
sat
by
the
shore
under
the
sun
with
my
feet
in
the
sand
but
you
brought
me
here
and
i'm
happy
that
you
did
'cause
now
i'm
as
free
as
birds
catching
the
wind
i
always
thought
i
would
sink
so
i
never
swam
i
never
went
boatin'
don't
get
how
they
are
floatin'
and
sometimes
i
get
so
scared
of
what
i
can't
understand
but
here
i
am
next
to
you
the
sky's
more
blue
in
malibu
next
to
you
in
malibu
next
to
you
baby
we
watched
the
sun
go
down
as
we
were
walking
i'd
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
just
standing
here
talking
you
would
explain
the
current
as
i
just
smile
hoping
that
you'll
stay
the
same
and
nothing
will
change
and
it'll
be
us
just
for
a
while
do
they
even
exist
that's
when
i
make
the
wish
to
swim
away
with
the
fish
is
it
supposed
to
be
this
hot
all
summer
long
i
never
would've
believed
you
if
three
years
ago
you
told
me
i'd
be
here
writing
this
song
but
here
i
am
next
to
you

flow
back

drowning
