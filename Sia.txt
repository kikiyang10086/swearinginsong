will
cry
you’ll
cry

intelligent
eyes
in
a
hunger-pang
frame
and
when
you
said
“hi”
i
forgot
my
dang
name
set
my
heart
aflame
ev’ry
part
aflame
this
is
not

you
might
also
like
you
strike
me
as

who
has
never
been

i
don’t

lasted

fidgeting
he
looked
askance
he’s
penniless
he’s
flying
by
the
seat
of
his
pants

handsome
boy
does
he
know
it
peach
fuzz
and
he
can’t
even
grow
it
i
wanna
take
him
far
away
from
this
place
then
i
turn
and
see
my
sister’s
face
and
she
is


helpless
and
i
know
she
is
helpless
and
her
eyes
are
just
helpless
and
i
realize
three
fundamental
truths
at
the
exact
same
time


i’m
a
girl
in
a
world
in
which
my
only
job
is
to
marry
rich
my
father
has
no
sons
so
i’m
the
one
who
has
to
social
climb
for
one
cause
i’m
the
oldest
and
the
wittiest
and
the
gossip
in
new
york
city
is
insidious
and
alexander
is
penniless
ha
that
doesn’t
mean
i
want
him
any
less




he’s
after
me
'cause
i’m
a
schuyler
sister
and
that
elevates
his
status
i’d
have
to
be
naïve
to
set
that
aside
maybe
that
is
why
i
introduce
him
to
eliza
now
that’s
his
bride
nice
going
angelica
he
was
right
you
will
never
be
satisfied





i
know
my
sister
like
i
know
my
own
mind
you
will
never
find
anyone
as
trusting
or
as
kind
if
i
tell
her
that
i
love
him
she’d
be
silently
resigned
he’d
be
mine
she
would
say
“i’m
fine”
but
she’d
be
lying

but
when
i
fantasize
at
night
it’s
alexander’s
eyes
as
i
romanticize
what
might
have
been
if
i
hadn’t
sized
him
up
so
quickly
at
least
my
dear
eliza’s
his
wife
at
least
i
keep
his
eyes
in
my
life…


to
the
groom

to
the
bride

from
your
sister

who
is
always
by
your
side

to
your
union
and
the
hope
that
you
provide


may
you
always
be
satisfied
and
i
know

she’ll
be
happy
as
his
bride
and
i
know
he
will
never
be
satisfied
i
will
never

i've
been

you
walk

you're
the

i
invoke
my
old
persistent
ghost
sent

me
queazy

take
