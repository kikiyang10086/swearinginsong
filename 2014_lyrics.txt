and
you
think
i'm
crazy
yeah
you
think
i'm
crazy
[eminem:]
i
wanted
the
fame
but
not
the
cover
of
newsweek
oh
well
guess
beggars
can't
be
choosey
wanted
to
receive
attention
for
my
music
wanted
to
be
left
alone
in
public.
excuse
me
for
wanting
my
cake
and
eat
it
too
and
wanting
it
both
ways
fame
made
me
a
balloon
'cause
my
ego
inflated
when
i
blew;
see
but
it
was
confusing
'cause
all
i
wanted
to
do
is
be
the
bruce
lee
of
loose
leaf
abused
ink
used
it
as
a
tool
when
i
blew
steam
wooh
hit
the
lottery
oh
wee
but
with
what
i
gave
up
to
get
it
was
bittersweet
it
was
like
winning
a
used
mink
ironic
'cause
i
think
i'm
getting
so
huge
i
need
a
shrink
i'm
beginning
to
lose
sleep:
one
sheep
two
sheep
going
cuckoo
and
cooky
as
kool
keith
but
i'm
actually
weirder
than
you
think
'cause
i'm
[rihanna:]
i'm
friends
with
the
monster
that's
under
my
bed
get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
you're
trying
to
save
me
stop
holding
your
breath
and
you
think
i'm
crazy
yeah
you
think
i'm
crazy
well
that's
nothing
well
that's
nothing
[eminem:]
now
i
ain't
much
of
a
poet
but
i
know
somebody
once
told
me
to
seize
the
moment
and
don't
squander
it
'cause
you
never
know
when
it
all
could
be
over
tomorrow
so
i
keep
conjuring
sometimes
i
wonder
where
these
thoughts
spawn
from
yeah
pondering'll
do
you
wonders.
no
wonder
you're
losing
your
mind
the
way
it
wanders.
yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
i
think
it
went
wandering
off
down
yonder
and
stumbled
on
'ta
jeff
vanvonderen
'cause
i
need
an
interventionist
to
intervene
between
me
and
this
monster
and
save
me
from
myself
and
all
this
conflict
'cause
the
very
thing
that
i
love's
killing
me
and
i
can't
conquer
it
my
ocd's

and
you

over
getting
told
to

up
in
the

so
there
so
all
the

it
wasn't
my
fault
and
everyone's

what
this

wants
is
release

one
day
you'll
make
a
dream
last

her
when

one
day
you'll

on

tonight
not
a

to
be
seen
a
kingdom
of
isolation
and
it
looks
like
i'm
the
queen
the
wind
is
howling
like
this
swirling
storm
inside
couldn't
keep
it
in
heaven
knows
i
tried
don't
let
them
in
don't
let

see
be
the

girl
you
always
have
to

it
back
anymore
let

slam
the

i
don't

what
they're
going
to
say
let
the
storm
rage
on
the
cold
never
bothered
me
anyway
it's
funny
how
some
distance
makes
everything
seem
small
and
the
fears
that
once
controlled
me
can't
get
to
me
at
all
it's
time
to
see
what
i
can
do
to
test
the
limits
and
break
through
no
right
no
wrong
no
rules
for
me
i'm

go
let

go
let
it
go
you'll
never
see
me
cry
here
i
stand
and
here
i'll
stay
let
the
storm
rage
on
my
power
flurries
through
the
air
into
the
ground
my
soul
is
spiraling
in
frozen
fractals
all
around
and
one
thought
crystallizes
like
an

ah
lahmlahlah
ah
lahmlahlah
i
met
this
girl
late
last
year
she
said
&quot;don't
you
worry
if
i
disappear.&quot;
i
told
her
i'm
not
really
looking
for
another
mistake
i
called
an
old
friend
thinking
that
the
trouble
would
wait
but
then
i
jump
right
in
a
week
later
returned
i
reckon
she
was
only
looking
for
a
lover
to
burn
but
i
gave
her
my
time
for
two
or
three
nights
then
i
put
it
on
pause
until
the
moment
was
right
i
went
away
for
months
until
our
paths
crossed
again
she
told
me
&quot;i
was
never
looking
for
a
friend.
maybe
you
could
swing
by
my
room
around
10:00.
baby
bring
a
lemon
and
a
bottle
of
gin.
we'll
be
in
between
the
sheets
'til
the
late
am.
baby
if
you
wanted
me
then
you
should've
just
said.&quot;
she's
singing
ah
lahmlahlah
don't
fuck
with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all
over
my
home
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
ah
lahmlahlah
don't
fuck
with
my
love
i
told
her
she
knows
take
aim
and
reload
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
ah
lahmlahlah
and
for
a
couple
weeks
i
only
wanna
see
her
we
drink
away
the
days
with
a
take-away
pizza
before
a
text
message
was
the
only
way
to
reach
her
now
she's
staying
at
my
place
and
loves
the
way
i
treat
her
singing
out
aretha
all
over
the
track
like
a
feature
and
never
wants
to
sleep
i
guess
that
i
don't
want
to
either
but
me
and
her
we
make
money
the
same
way
four
cities
two
planes
the
same
day
and
those
shows
have
never
been
what
it's
about
but
maybe
we'll
go
together
and
just
figure
it
out
i'd
rather
put
on
a
film
with
you
and
sit
on
a
couch
but
we
should
get
on
a
plane
or
we'll
be
missing
it
now
wish
i'd
have
written
it
down
the
way
that
things
played
out
when
she
was
kissing
him
how
i
was
confused
about
now
she
should
figure
it
out
while
i'm
sat
here
singing
ah
lahmlahlah
don't
fuck
with
my
love
that
heart
is
so
cold
all
over
my
home
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
ah
lahmlahlah
don't
fuck
with
my
love
i
told
her
she
knows
take
aim
and
reload
i
don't
wanna
know
that
babe
ah
lahmlahlah
[knock
knock
knock]
on
my
hotel
door
i
don't
even
know
if
she
knows
what
for
she
was
crying
on
my
shoulder
i
already
told
ya
trust
and
respect
is
what
we
do
this
for
i
never
intended
to
be
next
but
you
didn't
need
to
take
him
to
bed
that's
all
and
i
never
saw
him
as
a
threat
until
you
disappeared
with
him
to
have
sex
of
course
it's
not
like
we
were
both
on
tour
we
were
staying
on
the
same
fucking
hotel
floor
and
i
wasn't
looking
for
a
promise
or
commitment
but
it
was
never
just
fun
and
i
thought
you
were
different
this
is
not
the
way
you
realize
what
you
wanted
it's
a
bit
too
much
too
late
if
i'm
honest
and
all
this
time
god
knows
i'm
singing

this
love
is
a
blaze
i
saw
flames
from
the
side
of
the
stage
and
the
fire
brigade
comes
in
a
couple
of
days
until
then
we
got
nothing
to
say
and
nothing
to
know
but
something
to
drink
and
maybe
something
to
smoke
let
it
go
until
our
roads
are
changed
singing
we
found
love
in
a
local
rave
no
i
don't
really
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
say
but
i
can
just
figure
it
out
and
hope
and
pray
i
told
her
my
name
and
said
&quot;it's
nice
to
meet
ya.&quot;
then
she
handed
me
a
bottle
of
water
filled
with
tequila.
i
already
know
she's
a
keeper
just
from
this
one
small
act
of
kindness
i'm
in
deep
shit
if
anybody
finds
out
i'm
meant
to
drive
home
but
i've
drunk
all
of
it
now
not
sobering
up
we
just
sit
on
the
couch
one
thing
led

lack
of

or
you
can
start
speaking
up
nothing's
gonna
hurt
you
the
way
that
words
do
when
they
settle
'neath
your
skin
kept
on
the
inside
and
no
sunlight
sometimes
a
shadow
wins
but
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
you
say
what
you
wanna
say
and
let
the
words
fall
out
honestly
i

everybody's
been
there
everybody's
been
stared
down
by
the
enemy
fallen
for
the
fear
and
done
some
disappearing
bow
down
to
the
mighty
don't
run
stop
holding
your
tongue
maybe
there's
a
way
out
of
the

where
you
live
maybe
one
of
these
days
you

i
thought
about
our

how
it
felt

you
tasted
and
even
though
your

you
somewhere
feeling
lonely
even

he's
right

he
says
those

that
hurt
you

you
read

sometimes
i

was
it
just
a

if
what
we
had
was

how
could
you
be
fine

the
day
you
told

the

running
down
your

and
the

you
left
behind
you
didn't

like
to
see
them
i'll
admit
i
feel
alone

all
my

keep
asking
why

around
it
hurts
to

watch
another
nigga
at
the
top
you
know
that
if
you
wasn't
you
you
would
be
dissin'
you
dog
damn
okay
from
that
perspective
i
see
what
you're
talkin'
'bout
no
way
to
soften
that
'cause
me
i
was
tryna
find
out
where
i
lost
'em
at
but
maybe
i
ain't
lose
'em
at
all
maybe
i
keep
movin'
forward
and
they're
just
stagnant
they
ain't
movin'
at
all
but
when
they
need
a
favor
who
do
they
call
maybe
i'm
searchin'
for
the
problems
askin'
what
was
said
and
who
was
involved
too
focused
on
people's
feedback
and
provin'
'em
wrong
they
say
the
shoe
can
always
fit
no
matter
whose
foot
it's
on
these
days
feel
like
i'm
squeezin'
in
'em
whoever
wore
'em
before
just
wasn't
thinkin'
big
enough
i'm
'bout
to
leave
'em
with
'em
'cause
if
i
run
in
the
game
in
these
man
the
seams
are
splittin'
no
pun
intended
but
they're
smellin'
defeat
in
the
air
headed
where
nobody
took
it
who
meetin'
me
there
they
tell
him
that
he's
talkin'
crazy
but
he
doesn't
care
bein'
humble
don't
work
as
well
as
bein'
aware
