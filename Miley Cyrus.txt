i
never
came
to
the
beach
or
stood
by
the
ocean
i
never
sat
by
the
shore
under
the
sun
with
my
feet
in
the
sand
but
you
brought
me
here
and
i'm
happy
that
you
did
'cause
now
i'm
as
free
as
birds
catchin'
the
wind
i
always
thought
i
would
sink
so
i
never
swam
i
never
went
boatin'
don't
get
how
they
are
floatin'
and
sometimes
i
get
so
scared
of
what
i
can't
understand


but
here
i
am
next
to
you
the
sky's
more
blue
in
malibu
next
to
you
in
malibu
next
to
you

we
watched
the
sun
go
down
as
we
were
walkin'
i'd
spent
the
rest
of
my
life
just
standing
here
talkin'
you
would
explain
the
current
as
i
just
smile
hoping
that
you'll
stay
the
same
and
nothing
will
change
and
it'll
be
us
just
for
a
while
do
they
even
exist
that's
when
i
make
a
wish
to
swim
away
with
the
fish
cause
it's
supposed
to
be
this
hot
all
summer
long
i
never
would've
believed
you
if
three
years
ago
you
told
me
i'd
be
here
writing
this
song


but
here
i
am
next
to
you
the

next
to
you
the
sky's
so
blue
in
malibu
next
to
you


we
are
just
like
the
waves
that
flow
back
and
forth
sometimes
i
feel
like
i'm
drowning
and
you're
there
to
save
me
and
i
wanna
thank
you
