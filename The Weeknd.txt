i
guess
you
had
no
idea
that
you
could
have
persuaded
me
girl
you
could
have
had
me
doing
anything
you
pleased
girl
you
should
have
took
your
time
and
thought
of
what
to
say
to
me
'cause
i'm
not
as
hard
as
i
make
it
seem
to
be


and
it
could
have
went
so
many
ways
so
many
ways
it
can
go
'cause
ain't
nobody
feels
the
way
that
i
feel
when
i'm
alone
so
if
i
said
that
i
won't
call
the
lying
comes
natural
to
me
you
probably
could
have
had
it
all
you
could
have
been
that
lonely
star
if
we
just
went
on

if
we
just
went
on

if
we
just
went
on

if
we
just
went
on



happiness
exists
when
you
don't
know
a
thing
so
i
hope
you
don't
think
this
song
is
about
you
and
only
i
can
know
how
close
you
came
but
baby
i'm
a
pro
at
letting
go
i
love
it
when
they
come
and
go
see

"listen

from
the
morning
to
the
evening
complaints
from
the
tenants
got
the
walls
kicking
like
they
six
months
pregnant
drinking
alizé
with
our
cereal
for
breakfast
girls
calling
cabs
at
dawn
quarter
to
seven
sky's
getting
cold
we're
flying
from
the
north
rockin'
with
our
city
like
a
sold
out
show
house
full
of
pros
that
specialize
in
the
ho'in'
make
that

the
mission
visit
every
month
like
i'm
split
life
living
let
the
world
listen
if
a
hater's
caught
slipping
then
my
niggas
stay
tight
got
my
back
like
pippen
fast
life
gripping
yeah
we
still
tippin'
codeine
cups
paint
a
picture
so
vivid
fakes
try
to
mimic
get
