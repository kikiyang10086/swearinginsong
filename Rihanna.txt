the

page
of
our
story
the

seemed
so
bright
then
this
thing
turned
out
so
evil
i
don't
know
why
i'm
still
surprised
even
angels
have
their
wicked
schemes
and
you
take
that
to
new
extremes
but
you'll
always
be
my
hero
even
though
you've
lost
your
mind


just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
well
that's
alright
because
i
like
the
way
it
hurts
just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
well
that's
alright

i
love
the

you

i

there's
gravel
in
our
voices
glass
is
shattered
from
the
fight
in
this
tug
of
war
you'll
always
win
even
when
i'm
right
'cause
you
feed
me
fables
from
your
head
with
violent
words
and
empty
threats
and
it's
sick
that
all
these
battles
are
what
keeps
me
satisfied
you
might
also
like
just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
well
that's
alright
because
i
like
the
way
it
hurts
just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
well
that's
alright
because
i
love
the
way
you
lie
i

the

you

oh
i

you

oh


so
maybe
i'm
a
masochist
i
try
to
run
but
i
don't
wanna
ever
leave
'til
the
walls
are
going
up
in
smoke
with
all
our
memories


it's
morning
you
wake
a
sunray
hits
your
face
smeared
makeup
as
we
lay
in
the
wake
of
destruction

hush
baby
speak
softly
tell
me
you're
awfully
sorry
that
you
pushed
me
into
the
coffee
table
last
night
so
i
can
push
you
off
me
try
and
touch
me
so
i
can
scream
at
you
not
to
touch
me
run
out
the
room
and
i'll
follow
you
like
a
lost
puppy
baby
without
you
i'm
nothing
i'm
so
lost
hug
me
then
tell
me
how
ugly
i
am
but
that
you'll
always
love
me
then
after
that
shove
me
in
the
aftermath
of
the
destructive
path
that
we're
on
two
psychopaths
but
we
know
that
no
matter
how
many
knives
we
put
in
each
other's
backs
that
we'll
have
each
other's
backs
'cause
we're
that
lucky
together
we
