is
mine
for
the
milking
'til
nobody

even
fucking
feels
me
'til
it
kills
me
i
swear
to
god
i'll
be
the

illest
in
this
music
there
is
or
there
ever
will
be
disagree
feel
free
but
from
now
on
i'm
refusing
to
ever
give
up
only
thing
i
ever
gave
up's
using
no
more
excuses
excuse
me
if
my
head
is
too
big
for
this
building
and
pardon
me
if
i'm
a
cocky
prick
but
you
cocks
are
slick
popping
shit
on
how
you
flipped
your
life
around
crock-o-shit
who
you
dicks
tryna
kid
flip
&quot;dick&quot;
you
did
opposite
you
stayed
the

'cause
&quot;cock&quot;
backwards
is
still
&quot;cock&quot;
you
pricks
i
love
it
when
i
tell
'em
shove
it
'cause
it
wasn't
that
long
ago
when
marshall
sat
flustered
lacked
luster
'cause
he
couldn't
cut
mustard
muster
up
nothing
brain
fuzzy
'cause
he's
buzzin'
woke
up
from
that
buzzin'
now
you
wonder
why
he
does
it
how
he
does
it
wasn't
'cause
he
had
buzzards
circlin'
around
his
head
waiting
for
him
to
drop
dead
was
it
or
was
it
'cause
them
bitches
wrote
him
off
little
hussy
ass
scuzzes
fuck
it
guess
it
doesn't
matter
now
does
it
what
difference
it
make
what
it
take
to
get
it
through
your
thick
skulls
that
this
ain't
some
bullshit
people
don't
usually
come
back
this
way
from
a
place
that
was
dark
as
i
was
in
just
to
get
to
this
place
now
let
these
words
be
like
a
switch
blade
to
a
hater's
ribcage
and
let
it
be
known
that
from
this
day
forward
i
wanna
just
say
thanks
'cause
your
hate
is
what
gave
me
the
strength
so
let
'em
bics
raise
'cause
i
came

him
for
him
to
know
it
i
cried
plenty
tears
my
daddy

can
still
feel
it
in
the
air
see
her
pretty
face
run
my
fingers
through
her
hair
my
love
of
my
life
my
shorty
my
wife
she
left

won't
fly

will
never
make
it
by
without
you
without
you
i
can't
rest
i
can't
fight
all
i
need
is
you
and
i
without
you

you
you
you
without...
you
you
you
without...
you
i
can't
erase
so
i'll
take
blame
but
i
can't
accept
that
we're
estranged
without
you
without
you
i
can't
quit
now
this
can't
be
right
i
can't
take
one
more
sleepless
night
without
you
without
you
i
won't
soar
i
won't
climb
if
you're
not
here
i'm
paralyzed
without
you
without
you
i
can't
look
i'm
so
blind
i
lost
my
heart
i
lost
my
mind
without
you
without
you
oh
oh
oh
you
you
you
without...
you
you
you
without...
you
i
am
lost
i
am
vain
i
will
never
be
the
same
without
you
without
you
without...
you
i'm
so
glad
you
made
time
to
see
me
how's
life
tell
me
how's
your
family
i
haven't
seen
them
in
a
while
you've
been
good
busier
than
ever
we
small-talk
work
and
the
weather
your
guard
is
up
and
i
know
why
because
the
last
time
you
saw
me
is
still
burned
in
the
back
of
your
mind
you
gave
me
roses
and
i
left
them
there
to
die
so
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
&quot;i'm
sorry
for
that
night&quot;
and
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
it
turns
out
freedom
ain't
nothing
but
missing
you
wishing
i'd
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i'd
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
make
it
all
right
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
these
days
i
haven't
been
sleeping
staying
up
playing
back
myself
leaving
when
your
birthday
passed
and
i
didn't
call
and
i
think
about
summer
all
the
beautiful
times
i
watched
you
laughing
from
the
passenger
side
and
realized
i
loved
you
in
the
fall
and
then
the
cold
came
the
dark
days
when
fear
crept
into
my
mind
you
gave
me
all
your
love
and
all
i
gave
you
was
&quot;goodbye&quot;
so
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
&quot;i'm
sorry
for
that
night.&quot;
and
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
it
turns
out
freedom
ain't
nothing
but
missing
you
wishing
i'd
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i'd
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
i
miss
your
tanned
skin
your
sweet
smile
so
good
to
me
so
right
and
how
you
held
me
in
your
arms
that
september
night:
the
first
time
you
ever
saw
me
cry
maybe
this
is
wishful
thinking
probably
mindless
dreaming
but
if
we
loved
again
i
swear
i'd
love
you
right
i'd
go
back
in
time
and
change
it
but
i
can't
so
if
the
chain
is
on
your
door
i
understand
but
this
is
me
swallowing
my
pride
standing
in
front
of
you
saying
&quot;i'm
sorry
for
that
night.&quot;
and
i
go
back
to
december
it
turns
out
freedom
ain't
nothing
but
missing
you
wishing
i'd
realized
what
i
had
when
you
were
mine
i'd
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
make
it
all
right
i'd
go
back
to
december
turn
around
and
change
my
own
mind
i
go
back
to
december
all
the
time
all
the
time
you
think
i'm
pretty
without
any
make-up
on

think
i'm
funny

we
were
sittin'
up
there
on
your
momma's
roof
talkin'
'bout
everything
under
the
moon
with
the
smell
of
honeysuckle
and
your
perfume
all
i
could
think
about
was
my
next
move
oh
but
you
were
so
shy
so
was
i
maybe
that's
why
it
was
so
hard
to
believe
when
you
smiled
and
said
to
me
&quot;are
you
gonna
kiss
me
or
not
are
we
gonna
do
this
or
what
i
think
you
know
i
like
you
a
lot
but
you're
'bout
to
miss
your
shot
are
you
gonna
kiss
me
or
not&quot;
it
was
the
best
dang
kiss
that
i
ever
had
except
for
that
long
one
after
that
and
i
knew
if
i
wanted
this
thing
to
last
sooner
or
later
i'd
have
to
ask
for
your
hand
so
i
took
a
chance
bought
a
wedding
band
and
i
got
down
on
one
knee
and
you
smiled
and
said
to
me
&quot;are
you
gonna
kiss
me
or
not
are
we
gonna
do
this
or
what
i
think
you
know
i
love
you
a
lot
i
think
we've
got
a
real
good
shot
are
you
gonna
kiss
me
or
not&quot;
so
we
planned
it
all
out
for
the
middle
of
june
from
the
wedding
cake
to
the
honeymoon
and
your
momma
cried
when
you
walked
down
the
aisle
when
the
preacher
man
said
&quot;say
i
do&quot;
i
did
and
you
did
too
then
i
lifted
that
veil
and
saw
your
pretty
smile
and
i
said
&quot;are
you
gonna
kiss
me
or
not
are
we
gonna
do
this
or
what
look
at
all
the
love
that
we
got
it
ain't
never
gonna
stop
are
you
gonna
kiss
me
or
not&quot;
yeah

love
you
a
lot

got
a
shot

you
gonna
kiss
me
or
not
